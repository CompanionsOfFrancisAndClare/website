&#8220;On various levels, each fraternity is animated and guided by a council
and minister (or president) who are elected by the professed according
to the constitutions.&#8221; (references - Constitution: Title III, The
Fraternity at the Various Levels, The Local Fraternity, Articles 46 -
52 and Title IV, Election to and Termination of Offices. Articles 76 -
84)</span><br>

Ever come away from a fraternity election scratching your head,
wondering what in the world happened? The people you thought would be
elected weren&#8217;t and people who were elected were not even on the
ballot! The election seemed to progress like Topsy-Turvy without an
apparent reason or direction! </span></big>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">&nbsp;
The importance of the chapter of elections in a fraternity cannot be
underestimated. The fraternity council animates and guides some of the
most important aspects of our spiritual life - our ongoing Franciscan
formation and our fraternal community. &nbsp;The Fraternity Council
has
a very important role in our life as a Secular Franciscan.</span><br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#8217;s take a look at the task of the
local
Fraternity Council. As the SFO Rule states, each fraternity is animated
and guided by a council and minister. The word &#8220;animates&#8221; means to
&#8220;make full of spirit.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t mean to rule or dictate or even
direct. &nbsp;It means to encourage the spirit to grow within a
fraternity and to guide its expression. This is the first and most
important function of the council and the minister. Without a
fraternity&#8217;s animation or spirit, there is no fraternity! To gauge the
health of a fraternity, see if it has the Franciscan spirit, commonly
known as &#8220;Franciscan Joy.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice the placement of the words,
&#8220;council&#8221; and
&#8220;minister&#8221; in the Rule. The council comes first; the minister is
second. The minister is the servant leader who implements the guidance
of the council. The council is lead by the Holy Spirit working through
its members by discernment.</span><br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our General Constitutions state that the
office of
minister or councilor is a &#8220;fraternal service; a commitment to hold
oneself available and responsible in relation to each brother and
sister and to the fraternity so that each one will realize his or her
own vocation and each fraternity will be a true community, ecclesial
and Franciscan, actively present in the Church and in society.&#8221;</span></big></small></small><br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><small><span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">First,
it is a fraternal service; one among peers in offering one&#8217;s self in
service to each other so that each fraternity member can reach his/her
own full spiritual potential as a Franciscan. We minister to each other
when we are not on the council but even more so when we are. The
council also has a responsibility to ensure that the fraternity becomes
a true ecclesial Franciscan community. The council animates a
Franciscan identity in its members and fosters a unity of mission (but
can have a diversity of expression in various apostolates).
&nbsp;It is
extremely important that the Franciscan charism hold a prominent place
in the community, since it&#8217;s only in fraternity where we can nourish
our Franciscan identity.</span><br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<br style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">
<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what does &#8220;a true ecclesial
community mean?&#8221; It
means that the brothers and sisters should have a spirit of love for
each other, which reflect the Trinity to others, and being united like
the Father, Son and Spirit.&nbsp; If dissension or discord is
present,
the council must address it for the health of the fraternity.
&nbsp;The
council, at times, must make difficult decisions, but if issues are
left unaddressed, the fraternity spirit will be diminished, members
will leave and the fraternity will slowly die. Courageous action by the
council must be taken for the good of the fraternity. It is the role of
the fraternity members to stand behind their elected council, believing
that the Holy Spirit will be the council&#8217;s guide. &nbsp;How can we
discern who would make the best servant leaders of our fraternity? We
pray. We fast. We bring our concerns for the fraternity to prayer. We
hold in our hearts the issues affecting our fraternity and pray</span>
<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">for
discernment. We do not lobby for our candidate. &nbsp;We do not
debate.
It is about love and service, not power or persuasion.</span><small style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;"><small><br>
<br>
</small></small><span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why do the fraternity elections seem
so
haphazard? Why do they seem to take on a life of their own? Fraternity
elections are not like normal political elections we know from our
civic life. They are not popularity contests, based upon debates or
good looks. &nbsp;Just because there are surprises during elections
or
changes in the fraternity council, it does not mean the Holy Spirit is
not present. Our fraternity is actually directed by the Holy Spirit who
whispers and inspires at will. The Holy Spirit is in charge, not us! We
are only His instruments and pray that we do not get in His way. It is
the Spirit who enlivens our fraternity and who works through the
fraternity members. The Holy Spirit is in charge of the election and of
the fraternity.</span> &nbsp;<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">It is His
fraternity. It is His work. It is His Spirit&#8230;not ours.</span><br>
