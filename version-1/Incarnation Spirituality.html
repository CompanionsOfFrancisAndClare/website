  Mulholland OFM</span></b><br></big></p><big><strong>J</strong><strong>ohn Duns Scotus (c.1265-1308) is one of the most
  important thinkers in the history of Christian thought, and an aspect of that
  thought is crucially relevant to our world today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More known as a philosopher of great insight and perception,
  his primary contribution to theology is little known outside the Franciscan
  order, yet is one of the most dynamically creative moments in the development
  of Franciscan theology and spirituality.</strong><br><br><strong>Though a profound theological and philosophical
  thinker, Scotus was first and foremost a Franciscan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His doctrine of the Incarnation (more
  fully known as the Doctrine of the Absolute Primacy of Christ in the Universe)
  is firmly rooted in the Franciscan intellectual and spiritual tradition, at
  whose core is the Person of the Incarnate Son as this is experienced in the
  radical evangelical witness of Francis.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>At the center of the life of Francis is the Incarnate Crucified Lord
  of all creation, whom Francis called our &#8216;Elder Brother&#8217;; at the center of
  the life of Scotus is the Incarnate Person of the Son, whom he calls &#8216;God&#8217;s
  Masterpiece&#8217;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Scotus, the
  Incarnation is not a contingency plan when the original creative process of
  God goes awry because of sin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scotus
  rejects this notion as too central an emphasis on Man to the extent that the
  freedom of God to act in love is determined by an external necessity i.e. the
  redemption from sin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scotus
  understands the Incarnation as always being in the mind of God even before
  the historical and existential physicality of creation itself and the fact of
  sin.</strong><br style=""></big>
  <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><p class="MsoNormal"><big><strong><span style="color: black;">The Incarnation is the
model for creation: there is a creation only because of the Incarnation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this schema, the universe is for Christ
and not Christ for the universe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scotus
finds it inconceivable that the &#8216;greatest good in the universe&#8217; i.e. the
Incarnation, can be determined by some lesser good i.e. Man&#8217;s redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because such a sin-centered view of
the Incarnation suggests that the primary role of Christ is as an assuager of
the universe&#8217;s guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Absolute
Primacy, Christ is the beginning, middle and end of creation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stands at the center of the universe as
the reason for its existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
sense the universe has realized its creational potential more than Man, since
it is created with the potential to bear the God-Man and the Incarnation has
taken place historically and existentially.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Man, as yet, has failed to reach his potential to &#8216;love one another as I
have loved you&#8217;.</span></strong><b><span style="color: black;"><br style="">

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><strong><span style="color: black;">Scotus argues that the
reason for the Incarnation is Love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Love of God in himself and the free desire that God has to share that love with
another who can love him as perfectly as he loves himself, i.e. the Christ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scotus says that all the souls that were
ever created and about to be created could not, cannot and never will measure
up to the supreme love that Christ has for the Trinity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very fact of the preconception of the
Incarnation in Scotus&#8217;s thought means that we are co-heirs to this Trinitarian
love that Christ has.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Incarnation,
then in Duns Scotus, becomes the unrepeatable, unique, and single defining act
of God&#8217;s love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>God, says Scotus, is
what he is: we know that God exists and we know what that existence is:
Love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, if Man had not sinned
Christ would still have come, since this was predetermined from all eternity in
the mind of God as the supreme manifestation of his love for the creation he
brings about in his free act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Incarnation is the effect of God freely choosing to end his self-isolation and
show who and what He is to that creation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Incarnation, therefore, in Franciscan spirituality is centered on
Love and not sin.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sin has been given
too much prominence in contemporary soteriology: God redeems from sin because
he loves us?: no, says the Scotist, God loves us and then redeems us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Redemption is an act of love first and
foremost, not an act of saving us from sin, and the first act of redemption is
the Incarnation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>God foresees us in union
with him before he sees how sin disrupts that relational dynamic between He and
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scotus makes it clear that the
first movement is from God, a revelatory movement wherein God freely chooses to
move beyond his own self-loving and share that loving with something other than
himself &#8211; namely creation, and this process is epitomized in the Incarnation.<o:p></o:p></span></strong></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><b><span style="color: black;"><br>
<strong>What the Incarnation shows us is not primarily the need for redemption,
but the need that is in each one of us for love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That love which is so utterly free and unmerited that it embraces
our own limitations, our own failures, our own hopes and longings and in
uniting itself to us in the Incarnate Word in the person of Jesus of Nazareth
elevates the human project to that which it always was in the mind of God.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scotus begins with Love, that love which is
the very being of God himself, he travels the road of Love, which is made
manifest in the Incarnation, and he ends with love, that love so hard to see in
the misery of the abandoned Jesus on the cross, that Love which glorifies the
whole creational project in the Resurrection.<o:p></o:p></strong></span></b></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><b><span style="color: black;"><br>
<strong>Franciscan Spirituality sees the Incarnation as the guarantee of union
with God.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not something to be
hoped for or to be looked forward to &#8211; it is something, which is happening
NOW.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>God is Love and that Love is our
redemption and redemption is not primarily being saved from sin, but is rather
the gift of the possibility of openness to the experience of the divine Other
in our life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can it be otherwise
when we posit the notion of the divine and human in Jesus? Scotus&#8217;s doctrine of
the absolute centrality of Love is both timely and profoundly needed by our
world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Men and women cry out for an
experience of hope in a world which has lost direction &#8211; in the teaching of
Duns Scotus, Franciscan Spirituality has within its hand that hope-filled
experience and the end of that longing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For if God willed the Incarnation from all eternity, then it was always
his intention to become part of sinful creation &#8211; sin determines the manner of
that becoming, but it does not determine the fact that it was going to be. <o:p></o:p></strong></span></b></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><b><span style="color: black;"><br>
<strong>The incarnational thought of Duns Scotus needs a broader hearing, for
it is pertinent to all Christians and the world, not just the Catholic
tradition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Incarnation is of God,
not Man.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scotus is indeed in the
tradition of Francis and his incarnational theology is not complex &#8211; it is
utterly simple: God is love and all that has been, is and ever will be is
because God is love and is among us in Jesus among us in Jesus who is ever
present.<o:p></o:p></strong></span></b></big></p>
