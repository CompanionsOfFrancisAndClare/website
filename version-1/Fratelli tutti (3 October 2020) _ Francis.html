</big><p style="font-weight: bold; color: black;" align="center"><big><font size="+1"><big>ENCYCLICAL LETTER<i><br> FRATELLI TUTTI<br> </i>OF THE HOLY FATHER<br>FRANCIS<br>ON THE FRATERNITY AND SOCIAL FRIENDSHIP</big></font>  </big></p><big> 
</big><p style="font-weight: bold; color: black;"><big><font size="+1"><big>&nbsp;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>1. <i><a name="“FRATELLI_TUTTI”">“FRATELLI TUTTI”</a>.</i><a name="_ftnref1" title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
With these words, Saint Francis of Assisi addressed his brothers and
sisters and proposed to them a way of life marked by the flavour of the
Gospel. Of the counsels Francis offered, I would like to select the one
in which he calls for a love that transcends the barriers of geography
and distance, and declares blessed all those who love their brother “as
much when he is far away from him as when he is with him”.<a name="_ftnref2" title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>
In his simple and direct way, Saint Francis expressed the essence of a
fraternal openness that allows us to acknowledge, appreciate and love
each person, regardless of physical proximity, regardless of where he
or she was born or lives.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>2. This saint of fraternal love, simplicity and joy, who inspired me to write the Encyclical <i> <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">Laudato Si’</a></i>,
prompts me once more to devote this new Encyclical to fraternity and
social friendship. Francis felt himself a brother to the sun, the sea
and the wind, yet he knew that he was even closer to those of his own
flesh. Wherever he went, he sowed seeds of peace and walked alongside
the poor, the abandoned, the infirm and the outcast, the least of his
brothers and sisters.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="WITHOUT_BORDERS">WITHOUT BORDERS</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>3. There is an episode in the life of Saint Francis that shows his
openness of heart, which knew no bounds and transcended differences of
origin, nationality, colour or religion. It was his visit to Sultan
Malik-el-Kamil, in Egypt, which entailed considerable hardship, given
Francis’ poverty, his scarce resources, the great distances to be
traveled and their differences of language, culture and religion. That
journey, undertaken at the time of the Crusades, further demonstrated
the breadth and grandeur of his love, which sought to embrace everyone.
Francis’ fidelity to his Lord was commensurate with his love for his
brothers and sisters. Unconcerned for the hardships and dangers
involved, Francis went to meet the Sultan with the same attitude that
he instilled in his disciples: if they found themselves “among the
Saracens and other nonbelievers”, without renouncing their own identity
they were not to “engage in arguments or disputes, but to be subject to
every human creature for God’s sake”.<a name="_ftnref3" title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
In the context of the times, this was an extraordinary recommendation.
We are impressed that some eight hundred years ago Saint Francis urged
that all forms of hostility or conflict be avoided and that a humble
and fraternal “subjection” be shown to those who did not share his
faith.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>4. Francis did not wage a war of words aimed at imposing doctrines;
he simply spread the love of God. He understood that “God is love and
those who abide in love abide in God” (<i>1 Jn </i>4:16). In this way,
he became a father to all and inspired the vision of a fraternal
society. Indeed, “only the man who approaches others, not to draw them
into his own life, but to help them become ever more fully themselves,
can truly be called a father”.<a name="_ftnref4" title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
In the world of that time, bristling with watchtowers and defensive
walls, cities were a theatre of brutal wars between powerful families,
even as poverty was spreading through the countryside. Yet there
Francis was able to welcome true peace into his heart and free himself
of the desire to wield power over others. He became one of the poor and
sought to live in harmony with all. Francis has inspired these pages.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>5. Issues of human fraternity and social friendship have always been
a concern of mine. In recent years, I have spoken of them repeatedly
and in different settings. In this Encyclical, I have sought to bring
together many of those statements and to situate them in a broader
context of reflection. In the preparation of <i> <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">Laudato Si’</a></i>,
I had a source of inspiration in my brother Bartholomew, the Orthodox
Patriarch, who has spoken forcefully of our need to care for creation.
In this case, I have felt particularly encouraged by the Grand Imam
Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, with whom I met in Abu Dhabi, where we declared that
“God has created all human beings equal in rights, duties and dignity,
and has called them to live together as brothers and sisters”.<a name="_ftnref5" title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>
This was no mere diplomatic gesture, but a reflection born of dialogue
and common commitment. The present Encyclical takes up and develops
some of the great themes raised in the Document that we both signed. I
have also incorporated, along with my own thoughts, a number of
letters, documents and considerations that I have received from many
individuals and groups throughout the world.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>6. The following pages do not claim to offer a complete teaching on
fraternal love, but rather to consider its universal scope, its
openness to every man and woman. I offer this social Encyclical as a
modest contribution to continued reflection, in the hope that in the
face of present-day attempts to eliminate or ignore others, we may
prove capable of responding with a new vision of fraternity and social
friendship that will not remain at the level of words. Although I have
written it from the Christian convictions that inspire and sustain me,
I have sought to make this reflection an invitation to dialogue among
all people of good will.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>7. As I was writing this letter, the Covid-19 pandemic unexpectedly
erupted, exposing our false securities. Aside from the different ways
that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work
together became quite evident. For all our hyper-connectivity, we
witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve
problems that affect us all. Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to
be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to
refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>8. It is my desire that, in this our time, by acknowledging the
dignity of each human person, we can contribute to the rebirth of a
universal aspiration to fraternity. Fraternity between all men and
women. “Here we have a splendid secret that shows us how to dream and
to turn our life into a wonderful adventure. No one can face life in
isolation… We need a community that supports and helps us, in which we
can help one another to keep looking ahead. How important it is to
dream together… By ourselves, we risk seeing mirages, things that are
not there. Dreams, on the other hand, are built together”.<a name="_ftnref6" title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>
Let us dream, then, as a single human family, as fellow travelers
sharing the same flesh, as children of the same earth which is our
common home, each of us bringing the richness of his or her beliefs and
convictions, each of us with his or her own voice, brothers and sisters
all.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p align="center"><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="DARK_CLOUDS_OVER_A_CLOSED_WORLD">DARK CLOUDS OVER A CLOSED WORLD</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>9. Without claiming to carry out an exhaustive analysis or to study
every aspect of our present-day experience, I intend simply to consider
certain trends in our world that hinder the development of universal
fraternity.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="SHATTERED_DREAMS">SHATTERED DREAMS</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>10. For decades, it seemed that the world had learned a lesson from
its many wars and disasters, and was slowly moving towards various
forms of integration. For example, there was the dream of a united
Europe, capable of acknowledging its shared roots and rejoicing in its
rich diversity. We think of “the firm conviction of the founders of the
European Union, who envisioned a future based on the capacity to work
together in bridging divisions and in fostering peace and fellowship
between all the peoples of this continent”.<a name="_ftnref7" title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>
There was also a growing desire for integration in Latin America, and
several steps were taken in this direction. In some countries and
regions, attempts at reconciliation and rapprochement proved fruitful,
while others showed great promise.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>11. Our own days, however, seem to be showing signs of a certain
regression. Ancient conflicts thought long buried are breaking out
anew, while instances of a myopic, extremist, resentful and aggressive
nationalism are on the rise. In some countries, a concept of popular
and national unity influenced by various ideologies is creating new
forms of selfishness and a loss of the social sense under the guise of
defending national interests. Once more we are being reminded that
“each new generation must take up the struggles and attainments of past
generations, while setting its sights even higher. This is the path.
Goodness, together with love, justice and solidarity, are not achieved
once and for all; they have to be realized each day. It is not possible
to settle for what was achieved in the past and complacently enjoy it,
as if we could somehow disregard the fact that many of our brothers and
sisters still endure situations that cry out for our attention”.<a name="_ftnref8" title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>12. “Opening up to the world” is an expression that has been
co-opted by the economic and financial sector and is now used
exclusively of openness to foreign interests or to the freedom of
economic powers to invest without obstacles or complications in all
countries. Local conflicts and disregard for the common good are
exploited by the global economy in order to impose a single cultural
model. This culture unifies the world, but divides persons and nations,
for “as society becomes ever more globalized, it makes us neighbours,
but does not make us brothers”.<a name="_ftnref9" title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>
We are more alone than ever in an increasingly massified world that
promotes individual interests and weakens the communitarian dimension
of life. Indeed, there are markets where individuals become mere
consumers or bystanders. As a rule, the advance of this kind of
globalism strengthens the identity of the more powerful, who can
protect themselves, but it tends to diminish the identity of the weaker
and poorer regions, making them more vulnerable and dependent. In this
way, political life becomes increasingly fragile in the face of
transnational economic powers that operate with the principle of
“divide and conquer”. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="The_end_of_historical_consciousness">The end of historical consciousness</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>13. As a result, there is a growing loss of the sense of history,
which leads to even further breakup. A kind of “deconstructionism”,
whereby human freedom claims to create everything starting from zero,
is making headway in today’s culture. The one thing it leaves in its
wake is the drive to limitless consumption and expressions of empty
individualism. Concern about this led me to offer the young some
advice. “If someone tells young people to ignore their history, to
reject the experiences of their elders, to look down on the past and to
look forward to a future that he himself holds out, doesn’t it then
become easy to draw them along so that they only do what he tells them?
He needs the young to be shallow, uprooted and distrustful, so that
they can trust only in his promises and act according to his plans.
That is how various ideologies operate: they destroy (or deconstruct)
all differences so that they can reign unopposed. To do so, however,
they need young people who have no use for history, who spurn the
spiritual and human riches inherited from past generations, and are
ignorant of everything that came before them”.<a name="_ftnref10" title="" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>14. These are the new forms of cultural colonization. Let us not
forget that “peoples that abandon their tradition and, either from a
craze to mimic others or to foment violence, or from unpardonable
negligence or apathy, allow others to rob their very soul, end up
losing not only their spiritual identity but also their moral
consistency and, in the end, their intellectual, economic and political
independence”.<a name="_ftnref11" title="" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> One
effective way to weaken historical consciousness, critical thinking,
the struggle for justice and the processes of integration is to empty
great words of their meaning or to manipulate them. Nowadays, what do
certain words like democracy, freedom, justice or unity really mean?
They have been bent and shaped to serve as tools for domination, as
meaningless tags that can be used to justify any action.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="LACKING_A_PLAN_FOR_EVERYONE">LACKING A PLAN FOR EVERYONE</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>15. The best way to dominate and gain control over people is to
spread despair and discouragement, even under the guise of defending
certain values. Today, in many countries, hyperbole, extremism and
polarization have become political tools. Employing a strategy of
ridicule, suspicion and relentless criticism, in a variety of ways one
denies the right of others to exist or to have an opinion. Their share
of the truth and their values are rejected and, as a result, the life
of society is impoverished and subjected to the hubris of the powerful.
Political life no longer has to do with healthy debates about long-term
plans to improve people’s lives and to advance the common good, but
only with slick marketing techniques primarily aimed at discrediting
others. In this craven exchange of charges and counter-charges, debate
degenerates into a permanent state of disagreement and confrontation.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>16. Amid the fray of conflicting interests, where victory consists
in eliminating one’s opponents, how is it possible to raise our sights
to recognize our neighbours or to help those who have fallen along the
way? A plan that would set great goals for the development of our
entire human family nowadays sounds like madness. We are growing ever
more distant from one another, while the slow and demanding march
towards an increasingly united and just world is suffering a new and
dramatic setback.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>17. To care for the world in which we live means to care for
ourselves. Yet we need to think of ourselves more and more as a single
family dwelling in a common home. Such care does not interest those
economic powers that demand quick profits. Often the voices raised in
defence of the environment are silenced or ridiculed, using apparently
reasonable arguments that are merely a screen for special interests. In
this shallow, short-sighted culture that we have created, bereft of a
shared vision, “it is foreseeable that, once certain resources have
been depleted, the scene will be set for new wars, albeit under the
guise of noble claims”.<a name="_ftnref12" title="" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="A_“throwaway”_world">A “throwaway” world</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>18. Some parts of our human family, it appears, can be readily
sacrificed for the sake of others considered worthy of a carefree
existence. Ultimately, “persons are no longer seen as a paramount value
to be cared for and respected, especially when they are poor and
disabled, ‘not yet useful’ – like the unborn, or ‘no longer needed’ –
like the elderly. We have grown indifferent to all kinds of
wastefulness, starting with the waste of food, which is deplorable in
the extreme”.<a name="_ftnref13" title="" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>19. A decline in the birthrate, which leads to the aging of the
population, together with the relegation of the elderly to a sad and
lonely existence, is a subtle way of stating that it is all about us,
that our individual concerns are the only thing that matters. In this
way, “what is thrown away are not only food and dispensable objects,
but often human beings themselves”.<a name="_ftnref14" title="" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a>
We have seen what happened with the elderly in certain places in our
world as a result of the coronavirus. They did not have to die that
way. Yet something similar had long been occurring during heat waves
and in other situations: older people found themselves cruelly
abandoned. We fail to realize that, by isolating the elderly and
leaving them in the care of others without the closeness and concern of
family members, we disfigure and impoverish the family itself. We also
end up depriving young people of a necessary connection to their roots
and a wisdom that the young cannot achieve on their own.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>20. This way of discarding others can take a variety of forms, such
as an obsession with reducing labour costs with no concern for its
grave consequences, since the unemployment that it directly generates
leads to the expansion of poverty.<a name="_ftnref15" title="" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>
In addition, a readiness to discard others finds expression in vicious
attitudes that we thought long past, such as racism, which retreats
underground only to keep reemerging. Instances of racism continue to
shame us, for they show that our supposed social progress is not as
real or definitive as we think.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>21. Some economic rules have proved effective for growth, but not for integral human development.<a name="_ftnref16" title="" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> Wealth has increased, but together with inequality, with the result that “new forms of poverty are emerging”.<a name="_ftnref17" title="" href="#_ftn17">[17]</a>
The claim that the modern world has reduced poverty is made by
measuring poverty with criteria from the past that do not correspond to
present-day realities. In other times, for example, lack of access to
electric energy was not considered a sign of poverty, nor was it a
source of hardship. Poverty must always be understood and gauged in the
context of the actual opportunities available in each concrete
historical period.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Insufficiently_universal_human_rights">Insufficiently universal human rights</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>22. It frequently becomes clear that, in practice, human rights are
not equal for all. Respect for those rights “is the preliminary
condition for a country’s social and economic development. When the
dignity of the human person is respected, and his or her rights
recognized and guaranteed, creativity and interdependence thrive, and
the creativity of the human personality is released through actions
that further the common good”.<a name="_ftnref18" title="" href="#_ftn18">[18]</a>
Yet, “by closely observing our contemporary societies, we see numerous
contradictions that lead us to wonder whether the equal dignity of all
human beings, solemnly proclaimed seventy years ago, is truly
recognized, respected, protected and promoted in every situation. In
today’s world, many forms of injustice persist, fed by reductive
anthropological visions and by a profit-based economic model that does
not hesitate to exploit, discard and even kill human beings. While one
part of humanity lives in opulence, another part sees its own dignity
denied, scorned or trampled upon, and its fundamental rights discarded
or violated”.<a name="_ftnref19" title="" href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> What does this tell us about the equality of rights grounded in innate human dignity?</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>23. Similarly, the organization of societies worldwide is still far
from reflecting clearly that women possess the same dignity and
identical rights as men. We say one thing with words, but our decisions
and reality tell another story. Indeed, “doubly poor are those women
who endure situations of exclusion, mistreatment and violence, since
they are frequently less able to defend their rights”.<a name="_ftnref20" title="" href="#_ftn20">[20]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>24. We should also recognize that “even though the international
community has adopted numerous agreements aimed at ending slavery in
all its forms, and has launched various strategies to combat this
phenomenon, millions of people today – children, women and men of all
ages – are deprived of freedom and forced to live in conditions akin to
slavery… Today, as in the past, slavery is rooted in a notion of the
human person that allows him or her to be treated as an object… Whether
by coercion, or deception, or by physical or psychological duress,
human persons created in the image and likeness of God are deprived of
their freedom, sold and reduced to being the property of others. They
are treated as means to an end… [Criminal networks] are skilled in
using modern means of communication as a way of luring young men and
women in various parts of the world”.<a name="_ftnref21" title="" href="#_ftn21">[21]</a>
A perversion that exceeds all limits when it subjugates women and then
forces them to abort. An abomination that goes to the length of
kidnapping persons for the sake of selling their organs. Trafficking in
persons and other contemporary forms of enslavement are a worldwide
problem that needs to be taken seriously by humanity as a whole: “since
criminal organizations employ global networks to achieve their goals,
efforts to eliminate this phenomenon also demand a common and, indeed,
a global effort on the part of various sectors of society”.<a name="_ftnref22" title="" href="#_ftn22">[22]</a></big></font> </big></p><big>

many other affronts to human dignity are judged differently, depending
on how convenient it proves for certain, primarily economic, interests.
What is true as long as it is convenient for someone in power stops
being true once it becomes inconvenient. These situations of violence,
sad to say, “have become so common as to constitute a real ‘third world
war’ fought piecemeal”.<a name="_ftnref23" title="" href="#_ftn23">[23]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>26. This should not be surprising, if we realize that we no longer
have common horizons that unite us; indeed, the first victim of every
war is “the human family’s innate vocation to fraternity”. As a result,
“every threatening situation breeds mistrust and leads people to
withdraw into their own safety zone”.<a name="_ftnref24" title="" href="#_ftn24">[24]</a>
Our world is trapped in a strange contradiction: we believe that we can
“ensure stability and peace through a false sense of security sustained
by a mentality of fear and mistrust”.<a name="_ftnref25" title="" href="#_ftn25">[25]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>27. Paradoxically, we have certain ancestral fears that
technological development has not succeeded in eliminating; indeed,
those fears have been able to hide and spread behind new technologies.
Today too, outside the ancient town walls lies the abyss, the territory
of the unknown, the wilderness. Whatever comes from there cannot be
trusted, for it is unknown, unfamiliar, not part of the village. It is
the territory of the “barbarian”, from whom we must defend ourselves at
all costs. As a result, new walls are erected for self-preservation,
the outside world ceases to exist and leaves only “my” world, to the
point that others, no longer considered human beings possessed of an
inalienable dignity, become only “them”. Once more, we encounter “the
temptation to build a culture of walls, to raise walls, walls in the
heart, walls on the land, in order to prevent this encounter with other
cultures, with other people. And those who raise walls will end up as
slaves within the very walls they have built. They are left without
horizons, for they lack this interchange with others”.<a name="_ftnref26" title="" href="#_ftn26">[26]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>28. The loneliness, fear and insecurity experienced by those who
feel abandoned by the system creates a fertile terrain for various
“mafias”. These flourish because they claim to be defenders of the
forgotten, often by providing various forms of assistance even as they
pursue their criminal interests. There also exists a typically
“mafioso” pedagogy that, by appealing to a false communitarian
mystique, creates bonds of dependency and fealty from which it is very
difficult to break free.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>29. With the Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, we do not ignore the
positive advances made in the areas of science, technology, medicine,
industry and welfare, above all in developed countries. Nonetheless,
“we wish to emphasize that, together with these historical advances,
great and valued as they are, there exists a moral deterioration that
influences international action and a weakening of spiritual values and
responsibility. This contributes to a general feeling of frustration,
isolation and desperation”. We see “outbreaks of tension and a buildup
of arms and ammunition in a global context dominated by uncertainty,
disillusionment, fear of the future, and controlled by narrow economic
interests”. We can also point to “major political crises, situations of
injustice and the lack of an equitable distribution of natural
resources… In the face of such crises that result in the deaths of
millions of children – emaciated from poverty and hunger – there is an
unacceptable silence on the international level”.<a name="_ftnref27" title="" href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> This panorama, for all its undeniable advances, does not appear to lead to a more humane future.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>30. In today’s world, the sense of belonging to a single human
family is fading, and the dream of working together for justice and
peace seems an outdated utopia. What reigns instead is a cool,
comfortable and globalized indifference, born of deep disillusionment
concealed behind a deceptive illusion: thinking that we are
all-powerful, while failing to realize that we are all in the same
boat. This illusion, unmindful of the great fraternal values, leads to
“a sort of cynicism. For that is the temptation we face if we go down
the road of disenchantment and disappointment… Isolation and withdrawal
into one’s own interests are never the way to restore hope and bring
about renewal. Rather, it is closeness; it is the culture of encounter.
Isolation, no; closeness, yes. Culture clash, no; culture of encounter,
yes”.<a name="_ftnref28" title="" href="#_ftn28">[28]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>31. In this world that races ahead, yet lacks a shared roadmap, we
increasingly sense that “the gap between concern for one’s personal
well-being and the prosperity of the larger human family seems to be
stretching to the point of complete division between individuals and
human community… It is one thing to feel forced to live together, but
something entirely different to value the richness and beauty of those
seeds of common life that need to be sought out and cultivated”.<a name="_ftnref29" title="" href="#_ftn29">[29]</a>
Technology is constantly advancing, yet “how wonderful it would be if
the growth of scientific and technological innovation could come with
more equality and social inclusion. How wonderful would it be, even as
we discover faraway planets, to rediscover the needs of the brothers
and sisters who orbit around us”.<a name="_ftnref30" title="" href="#_ftn30">[30]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>32. True, a worldwide tragedy like the Covid-19 pandemic momentarily
revived the sense that we are a global community, all in the same boat,
where one person’s problems are the problems of all. Once more we
realized that no one is saved alone; we can only be saved together. As
I said in those days, “the storm has exposed our vulnerability and
uncovered those false and superfluous certainties around which we
constructed our daily schedules, our projects, our habits and
priorities… Amid this storm, the façade of those stereotypes with which
we camouflaged our egos, always worrying about appearances, has fallen
away, revealing once more the ineluctable and blessed awareness that we
are part of one another, that we are brothers and sisters of one
another”.<a name="_ftnref31" title="" href="#_ftn31">[31]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>33. The world was relentlessly moving towards an economy that,
thanks to technological progress, sought to reduce “human costs”; there
were those who would have had us believe that freedom of the market was
sufficient to keep everything secure. Yet the brutal and unforeseen
blow of this uncontrolled pandemic forced us to recover our concern for
human beings, for everyone, rather than for the benefit of a few. Today
we can recognize that “we fed ourselves on dreams of splendour and
grandeur, and ended up consuming distraction, insularity and solitude.
We gorged ourselves on networking, and lost the taste of fraternity. We
looked for quick and safe results, only to find ourselves overwhelmed
by impatience and anxiety. Prisoners of a virtual reality, we lost the
taste and flavour of the truly real”.<a name="_ftnref32" title="" href="#_ftn32">[32]</a>
The pain, uncertainty and fear, and the realization of our own
limitations, brought on by the pandemic have only made it all the more
urgent that we rethink our styles of life, our relationships, the
organization of our societies and, above all, the meaning of our
existence.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>34. If everything is connected, it is hard to imagine that this
global disaster is unrelated to our way of approaching reality, our
claim to be absolute masters of our own lives and of all that exists. I
do not want to speak of divine retribution, nor would it be sufficient
to say that the harm we do to nature is itself the punishment for our
offences. The world is itself crying out in rebellion. We are reminded
of the well-known verse of the poet Virgil that evokes the “tears of
things”, the misfortunes of life and history.<a name="_ftnref33" title="" href="#_ftn33">[33]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>35. All too quickly, however, we forget the lessons of history, “the teacher of life”.<a name="_ftnref34" title="" href="#_ftn34">[34]</a>
Once this health crisis passes, our worst response would be to plunge
even more deeply into feverish consumerism and new forms of egotistic
self-preservation. God willing, after all this, we will think no longer
in terms of “them” and “those”, but only “us”. If only this may prove
not to be just another tragedy of history from which we learned
nothing. If only we might keep in mind all those elderly persons who
died for lack of respirators, partly as a result of the dismantling,
year after year, of healthcare systems. If only this immense sorrow may
not prove useless, but enable us to take a step forward towards a new
style of life. If only we might rediscover once for all that we need
one another, and that in this way our human family can experience a
rebirth, with all its faces, all its hands and all its voices, beyond
the walls that we have erected.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>36. Unless we recover the shared passion to create a community of
belonging and solidarity worthy of our time, our energy and our
resources, the global illusion that misled us will collapse and leave
many in the grip of anguish and emptiness. Nor should we naively refuse
to recognize that “obsession with a consumerist lifestyle, above all
when few people are capable of maintaining it, can only lead to
violence and mutual destruction”.<a name="_ftnref35" title="" href="#_ftn35">[35]</a> The notion of “every man for himself” will rapidly degenerate into a free-for-all that would prove worse than any pandemic.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>37. Certain populist political regimes, as well as certain liberal
economic approaches, maintain that an influx of migrants is to be
prevented at all costs. Arguments are also made for the propriety of
limiting aid to poor countries, so that they can hit rock bottom and
find themselves forced to take austerity measures. One fails to realize
that behind such statements, abstract and hard to support, great
numbers of lives are at stake. Many migrants have fled from war,
persecution and natural catastrophes. Others, rightly, “are seeking
opportunities for themselves and their families. They dream of a better
future and they want to create the conditions for achieving it”.<a name="_ftnref36" title="" href="#_ftn36">[36]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>38. Sadly, some “are attracted by Western culture, sometimes with
unrealistic expectations that expose them to grave disappointments.
Unscrupulous traffickers, frequently linked to drug cartels or arms
cartels, exploit the weakness of migrants, who too often experience
violence, trafficking, psychological and physical abuse and untold
sufferings on their journey”.<a name="_ftnref37" title="" href="#_ftn37">[37]</a><a name="_ftnref38" title="" href="#_ftn38">[38]</a> For this reason, “there is also a need to reaffirm the right not to emigrate, that is, to remain in one’s homeland”.<a name="_ftnref39" title="" href="#_ftn39">[39]</a>
Those who emigrate “experience separation from their place of origin,
and often a cultural and religious uprooting as well. Fragmentation is
also felt by the communities they leave behind, which lose their most
vigorous and enterprising elements, and by families, especially when
one or both of the parents migrates, leaving the children in the
country of origin”.</big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>39. Then too, “in some host countries, migration causes fear and
alarm, often fomented and exploited for political purposes. This can
lead to a xenophobic mentality, as people close in on themselves, and
it needs to be addressed decisively”.<a name="_ftnref40" title="" href="#_ftn40">[40]</a>
Migrants are not seen as entitled like others to participate in the
life of society, and it is forgotten that they possess the same
intrinsic dignity as any person. Hence they ought to be “agents in
their own redemption”.<a name="_ftnref41" title="" href="#_ftn41">[41]</a>
No one will ever openly deny that they are human beings, yet in
practice, by our decisions and the way we treat them, we can show that
we consider them less worthy, less important, less human. For
Christians, this way of thinking and acting is unacceptable, since it
sets certain political preferences above deep convictions of our faith:
the inalienable dignity of each human person regardless of origin, race
or religion, and the supreme law of fraternal love.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>40. “Migrations, more than ever before, will play a pivotal role in the future of our world”.<a name="_ftnref42" title="" href="#_ftn42">[42]</a>
At present, however, migration is affected by the “loss of that sense
of responsibility for our brothers and sisters on which every civil
society is based”.<a name="_ftnref43" title="" href="#_ftn43">[43]</a>
Europe, for example, seriously risks taking this path. Nonetheless,
“aided by its great cultural and religious heritage, it has the means
to defend the centrality of the human person and to find the right
balance between its twofold moral responsibility to protect the rights
of its citizens and to assure assistance and acceptance to migrants”.<a name="_ftnref44" title="" href="#_ftn44">[44]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>41. I realize that some people are hesitant and fearful with regard
to migrants. I consider this part of our natural instinct of
self-defence. Yet it is also true that an individual and a people are
only fruitful and productive if they are able to develop a creative
openness to others. I ask everyone to move beyond those primal
reactions because “there is a problem when doubts and fears condition
our way of thinking and acting to the point of making us intolerant,
closed and perhaps even – without realizing it – racist. In this way,
fear deprives us of the desire and the ability to encounter the other”.<a name="_ftnref45" title="" href="#_ftn45">[45]</a></big></font> </big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>42. Oddly enough, while closed and intolerant attitudes towards
others are on the rise, distances are otherwise shrinking or
disappearing to the point that the right to privacy scarcely exists.
Everything has become a kind of spectacle to be examined and inspected,
and people’s lives are now under constant surveillance. Digital
communication wants to bring everything out into the open; people’s
lives are combed over, laid bare and bandied about, often anonymously.
Respect for others disintegrates, and even as we dismiss, ignore or
keep others distant, we can shamelessly peer into every detail of their
lives.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>42. Digital campaigns of hatred and destruction, for their part, are
not – as some would have us believe – a positive form of mutual
support, but simply an association of individuals united against a
perceived common enemy. “Digital media can also expose people to the
risk of addiction, isolation and a gradual loss of contact with
concrete reality, blocking the development of authentic interpersonal
relationships”.<a name="_ftnref46" title="" href="#_ftn46">[46]</a>
They lack the physical gestures, facial expressions, moments of
silence, body language and even the smells, the trembling of hands, the
blushes and perspiration that speak to us and are a part of human
communication. Digital relationships, which do not demand the slow and
gradual cultivation of friendships, stable interaction or the building
of a consensus that matures over time, have the appearance of
sociability. Yet they do not really build community; instead, they tend
to disguise and expand the very individualism that finds expression in
xenophobia and in contempt for the vulnerable. Digital connectivity is
not enough to build bridges. It is not capable of uniting humanity.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>44. Even as individuals maintain their comfortable consumerist
isolation, they can choose a form of constant and febrile bonding that
encourages remarkable hostility, insults, abuse, defamation and verbal
violence destructive of others, and this with a lack of restraint that
could not exist in physical contact without tearing us all apart.
Social aggression has found unparalleled room for expansion through
computers and mobile devices.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>45. This has now given free rein to ideologies. Things that until a
few years ago could not be said by anyone without risking the loss of
universal respect can now be said with impunity, and in the crudest of
terms, even by some political figures. Nor should we forget that “there
are huge economic interests operating in the digital world, capable of
exercising forms of control as subtle as they are invasive, creating
mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the democratic
process. The way many platforms work often ends up favouring encounter
between persons who think alike, shielding them from debate. These
closed circuits facilitate the spread of fake news and false
information, fomenting prejudice and hate”.<a name="_ftnref47" title="" href="#_ftn47">[47]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>46. We should also recognize that destructive forms of fanaticism
are at times found among religious believers, including Christians;
they too “can be caught up in networks of verbal violence through the
internet and the various forums of digital communication. Even in
Catholic media, limits can be overstepped, defamation and slander can
become commonplace, and all ethical standards and respect for the good
name of others can be abandoned”.<a name="_ftnref48" title="" href="#_ftn48">[48]</a> How can this contribute to the fraternity that our common Father asks of us?</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Information_without_wisdom">Information without wisdom</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>47. True wisdom demands an encounter with reality. Today, however,
everything can be created, disguised and altered. A direct encounter
even with the fringes of reality can thus prove intolerable. A
mechanism of selection then comes into play, whereby I can immediately
separate likes from dislikes, what I consider attractive from what I
deem distasteful. In the same way, we can choose the people with whom
we wish to share our world. Persons or situations we find unpleasant or
disagreeable are simply deleted in today’s virtual networks; a virtual
circle is then created, isolating us from the real world in which we
are living.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>48. The ability to sit down and listen to others, typical of
interpersonal encounters, is paradigmatic of the welcoming attitude
shown by those who transcend narcissism and accept others, caring for
them and welcoming them into their lives. Yet “today’s world is largely
a deaf world… At times, the frantic pace of the modern world prevents
us from listening attentively to what another person is saying. Halfway
through, we interrupt him and want to contradict what he has not even
finished saying. We must not lose our ability to listen”. Saint Francis
“heard the voice of God, he heard the voice of the poor, he heard the
voice of the infirm and he heard the voice of nature. He made of them a
way of life. My desire is that the seed that Saint Francis planted may
grow in the hearts of many”.<a name="_ftnref49" title="" href="#_ftn49">[49]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>49. As silence and careful listening disappear, replaced by a frenzy
of texting, this basic structure of sage human communication is at
risk. A new lifestyle is emerging, where we create only what we want
and exclude all that we cannot control or know instantly and
superficially. This process, by its intrinsic logic, blocks the kind of
serene reflection that could lead us to a shared wisdom.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>50. Together, we can seek the truth in dialogue, in relaxed
conversation or in passionate debate. To do so calls for perseverance;
it entails moments of silence and suffering, yet it can patiently
embrace the broader experience of individuals and peoples. The flood of
information at our fingertips does not make for greater wisdom. Wisdom
is not born of quick searches on the internet nor is it a mass of
unverified data. That is not the way to mature in the encounter with
truth. Conversations revolve only around the latest data; they become
merely horizontal and cumulative. We fail to keep our attention
focused, to penetrate to the heart of matters, and to recognize what is
essential to give meaning to our lives. Freedom thus becomes an
illusion that we are peddled, easily confused with the ability to
navigate the internet. The process of building fraternity, be it local
or universal, can only be undertaken by spirits that are free and open
to authentic encounters.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>51. Certain economically prosperous countries tend to be proposed as
cultural models for less developed countries; instead, each of those
countries should be helped to grow in its own distinct way and to
develop its capacity for innovation while respecting the values of its
proper culture. A shallow and pathetic desire to imitate others leads
to copying and consuming in place of creating, and fosters low national
self-esteem. In the affluent sectors of many poor countries, and at
times in those who have recently emerged from poverty, there is a
resistance to native ways of thinking and acting, and a tendency to
look down on one’s own cultural identity, as if it were the sole cause
of every ill.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>52. Destroying self-esteem is an easy way to dominate others. Behind
these trends that tend to level our world, there flourish powerful
interests that take advantage of such low self-esteem, while
attempting, through the media and networks, to create a new culture in
the service of the elite. This plays into the opportunism of financial
speculators and raiders, and the poor always end up the losers. Then
too, ignoring the culture of their people has led to the inability of
many political leaders to devise an effective development plan that
could be freely accepted and sustained over time.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>53. We forget that “there is no worse form of alienation than to
feel uprooted, belonging to no one. A land will be fruitful, and its
people bear fruit and give birth to the future, only to the extent that
it can foster a sense of belonging among its members, create bonds of
integration between generations and different communities, and avoid
all that makes us insensitive to others and leads to further
alienation”.<a name="_ftnref50" title="" href="#_ftn50">[50]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

like in the following pages to take up and discuss many new paths of
hope. For God continues to sow abundant seeds of goodness in our human
family. The recent pandemic enabled us to recognize and appreciate once
more all those around us who, in the midst of fear, responded by
putting their lives on the line. We began to realize that our lives are
interwoven with and sustained by ordinary people valiantly shaping the
decisive events of our shared history: doctors, nurses, pharmacists,
storekeepers and supermarket workers, cleaning personnel, caretakers,
transport workers, men and women working to provide essential services
and public safety, volunteers, priests and religious… They understood
that no one is saved alone.<a name="_ftnref51" title="" href="#_ftn51">[51]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>55. I invite everyone to renewed hope, for hope “speaks to us of
something deeply rooted in every human heart, independently of our
circumstances and historical conditioning. Hope speaks to us of a
thirst, an aspiration, a longing for a life of fulfillment, a desire to
achieve great things, things that fill our heart and lift our spirit to
lofty realities like truth, goodness and beauty, justice and love… Hope
is bold; it can look beyond personal convenience, the petty securities
and compensations which limit our horizon, and it can open us up to
grand ideals that make life more beautiful and worthwhile”.<a name="_ftnref52" title="" href="#_ftn52">[52]</a> Let us continue, then, to advance along the paths of hope.</big></font></big></p><big>

description of today’s problems, for “the joys and hopes, the grief and
anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or

In the attempt to search for a ray of light in the midst of what we are
experiencing, and before proposing a few lines of action, I now wish to
devote a chapter to a parable told by Jesus Christ two thousand years
ago. Although this Letter is addressed to all people of good will,
regardless of their religious convictions, the parable is one that any
of us can relate to and find challenging.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i> “Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. ‘Teacher,’ he said,
‘what must I do to inherit eternal life?’ He said to him, ‘What is
written in the law? What do you read there?’ He answered, ‘You shall
love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and
with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as
yourself.’ And he said to him, ‘You have given the right answer; do
this, and you will live.’ But wanting to justify himself, he asked
Jesus, ‘And who is my neighbour?’ Jesus replied, ‘A man was going down
from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who
stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. Now by
chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him, he
passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the
place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan while
traveling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity.
He went to him and bandaged his wounds, having poured oil and wine on
them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and
took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii, gave them to
the innkeeper, and said, ‘Take care of him; and when I come back, I
will repay you whatever more you spend.’ Which of these three, do you
think, was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of the
robbers?” He said, ‘The one who showed him mercy.’ Jesus said to him,
‘Go and do likewise.’”</i>(<i>Lk</i> 10:25-37).</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>57. This parable has to do with an age-old problem. Shortly after
its account of the creation of the world and of man, the Bible takes up
the issue of human relationships. Cain kills his brother Abel and then
hears God ask: “Where is your brother Abel?” (<i>Gen</i> 4:9). His
answer is one that we ourselves all too often give: “Am I my brother’s
keeper?” (ibid.). By the very question he asks, God leaves no room for
an appeal to determinism or fatalism as a justification for our own
indifference. Instead, he encourages us to create a different culture,
in which we resolve our conflicts and care for one another.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>58. The Book of Job sees our origin in the one Creator as the basis
of certain common rights: “Did not he who made me in the womb also make
him? And did not the same one fashion us in the womb?” (<i>Job</i>
31:15). Many centuries later, Saint Irenaeus would use the image of a
melody to make the same point: “One who seeks the truth should not
concentrate on the differences between one note and another, thinking
as if each was created separately and apart from the others; instead,
he should realize that one and the same person composed the entire
melody”.<a name="_ftnref54" title="" href="#_ftn54">[54]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>59. In earlier Jewish traditions, the imperative to love and care
for others appears to have been limited to relationships between
members of the same nation. The ancient commandment to “love your
neighbour as yourself” (<i>Lev</i> 19:18) was usually understood as
referring to one’s fellow citizens, yet the boundaries gradually
expanded, especially in the Judaism that developed outside of the land
of Israel. We encounter the command not to do to others what you would
not want them to do to you (cf. <i>Tob</i> 4:15). In the first century before Christ, Rabbi Hillel stated: “This is the entire Torah. Everything else is commentary”.<a name="_ftnref55" title="" href="#_ftn55">[55]</a>
The desire to imitate God’s own way of acting gradually replaced the
tendency to think only of those nearest us: “The compassion of man is
for his neighbour, but the compassion of the Lord is for all living
beings” (<i>Sir</i> 18:13).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>60. In the New Testament, Hillel’s precept was expressed in positive
terms: “In everything, do to others as you would have them do to you;
for this is the law and the prophets” (<i>Mt</i> 7:12). This command is
universal in scope, embracing everyone on the basis of our shared
humanity, since the heavenly Father “makes his sun rise on the evil and
on the good” (<i>Mt</i> 5:45). Hence the summons to “be merciful, just as your Father is merciful” (<i>Lk</i> 6:36).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>61. In the oldest texts of the Bible, we find a reason why our
hearts should expand to embrace the foreigner. It derives from the
enduring memory of the Jewish people that they themselves had once
lived as foreigners in Egypt:</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i> “You shall not wrong or oppress a stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt” </i>(<i>Ex</i> 22:21).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i> “You shall not oppress a stranger; you know the heart of a stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt” </i>(<i>Ex</i> 23:9).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i> “When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not do
him wrong. The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the
citizen among you; you shall love the stranger as yourself, for you
were strangers in the land of Egypt” </i>(Lev 19:33-34).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i> “When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, do not glean what
is left; it shall be for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow.
Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt” </i>(<i>Deut</i> 24:21-22).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big> The call to fraternal love echoes throughout the New Testament:</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i> “For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself’” </i>(<i>Gal</i> 5:14).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i> “Whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light, and in
such a person there is no cause for stumbling. But whoever hates
another believer is in the darkness” </i>(<i>1 Jn</i> 2:10-11).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i> “We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another. Whoever does not love abides in death” </i>(<i>1 Jn</i> 3:14).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i> “Those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen” </i>(<i>1 Jn</i> 4:20).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>62. Yet this call to love could be misunderstood. Saint Paul,
recognizing the temptation of the earliest Christian communities to
form closed and isolated groups, urged his disciples to abound in love
“for one another and for all” (<i>1 Thess</i> 3:12). In the Johannine community, fellow Christians were to be welcomed, “even though they are strangers to you” (<i>3 Jn</i>
5). In this context, we can better understand the significance of the
parable of the Good Samaritan: love does not care if a brother or
sister in need comes from one place or another. For “love shatters the
chains that keep us isolated and separate; in their place, it builds
bridges. Love enables us to create one great family, where all of us
can feel at home… Love exudes compassion and dignity”.<a name="_ftnref56" title="" href="#_ftn56">[56]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Abandoned_on_the_wayside_">Abandoned on the wayside</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>63. Jesus tells the story of a man assaulted by thieves and lying
injured on the wayside. Several persons passed him by, but failed to
stop. These were people holding important social positions, yet lacking
in real concern for the common good. They would not waste a couple of
minutes caring for the injured man, or even in calling for help. Only
one person stopped, approached the man and cared for him personally,
even spending his own money to provide for his needs. He also gave him
something that in our frenetic world we cling to tightly: he gave him
his time. Certainly, he had his own plans for that day, his own needs,
commitments and desires. Yet he was able to put all that aside when
confronted with someone in need. Without even knowing the injured man,
he saw him as deserving of his time and attention.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>64. Which of these persons do you identify with? This question,
blunt as it is, is direct and incisive. Which of these characters do
you resemble? We need to acknowledge that we are constantly tempted to
ignore others, especially the weak. Let us admit that, for all the
progress we have made, we are still “illiterate” when it comes to
accompanying, caring for and supporting the most frail and vulnerable
members of our developed societies. We have become accustomed to
looking the other way, passing by, ignoring situations until they
affect us directly.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>65. Someone is assaulted on our streets, and many hurry off as if
they did not notice. People hit someone with their car and then flee
the scene. Their only desire is to avoid problems; it does not matter
that, through their fault, another person could die. All these are
signs of an approach to life that is spreading in various and subtle
ways. What is more, caught up as we are with our own needs, the sight
of a person who is suffering disturbs us. It makes us uneasy, since we
have no time to waste on other people’s problems. These are symptoms of
an unhealthy society. A society that seeks prosperity but turns its
back on suffering.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>66. May we not sink to such depths! Let us look to the example of
the Good Samaritan. Jesus’ parable summons us to rediscover our
vocation as citizens of our respective nations and of the entire world,
builders of a new social bond. This summons is ever new, yet it is
grounded in a fundamental law of our being: we are called to direct
society to the pursuit of the common good and, with this purpose in
mind, to persevere in consolidating its political and social order, its
fabric of relations, its human goals. By his actions, the Good
Samaritan showed that “the existence of each and every individual is
deeply tied to that of others: life is not simply time that passes;
life is a time for interactions”.<a name="_ftnref57" title="" href="#_ftn57">[57]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>67. The parable eloquently presents the basic decision we need to
make in order to rebuild our wounded world. In the face of so much pain
and suffering, our only course is to imitate the Good Samaritan. Any
other decision would make us either one of the robbers or one of those
who walked by without showing compassion for the sufferings of the man
on the roadside. The parable shows us how a community can be rebuilt by
men and women who identify with the vulnerability of others, who reject
the creation of a society of exclusion, and act instead as neighbours,
lifting up and rehabilitating the fallen for the sake of the common
good. At the same time, it warns us about the attitude of those who
think only of themselves and fail to shoulder the inevitable
responsibilities of life as it is.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>68. The parable clearly does not indulge in abstract moralizing, nor
is its message merely social and ethical. It speaks to us of an
essential and often forgotten aspect of our common humanity: we were
created for a fulfilment that can only be found in love. We cannot be
indifferent to suffering; we cannot allow anyone to go through life as
an outcast. Instead, we should feel indignant, challenged to emerge
from our comfortable isolation and to be changed by our contact with
human suffering. That is the meaning of dignity.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="A_story_constantly_retold__">A story constantly retold </a> </i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>69. The parable is clear and straightforward, yet it also evokes the
interior struggle that each of us experiences as we gradually come to
know ourselves through our relationships with our brothers and sisters.
Sooner or later, we will all encounter a person who is suffering. Today
there are more and more of them. The decision to include or exclude
those lying wounded along the roadside can serve as a criterion for
judging every economic, political, social and religious project. Each
day we have to decide whether to be Good Samaritans or indifferent
bystanders. And if we extend our gaze to the history of our own lives
and that of the entire world, all of us are, or have been, like each of
the characters in the parable. All of us have in ourselves something of
the wounded man, something of the robber, something of the passers-by,
and something of the Good Samaritan.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>70. It is remarkable how the various characters in the story change,
once confronted by the painful sight of the poor man on the roadside.
The distinctions between Judean and Samaritan, priest and merchant,
fade into insignificance. Now there are only two kinds of people: those
who care for someone who is hurting and those who pass by; those who
bend down to help and those who look the other way and hurry off. Here,
all our distinctions, labels and masks fall away: it is the moment of
truth. Will we bend down to touch and heal the wounds of others? Will
we bend down and help another to get up? This is today’s challenge, and
we should not be afraid to face it. In moments of crisis, decisions
become urgent. It could be said that, here and now, anyone who is
neither a robber nor a passer-by is either injured himself or bearing
an injured person on his shoulders.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>71. The story of the Good Samaritan is constantly being repeated. We
can see this clearly as social and political inertia is turning many
parts of our world into a desolate byway, even as domestic and
international disputes and the robbing of opportunities are leaving
great numbers of the marginalized stranded on the roadside. In his
parable, Jesus does not offer alternatives; he does not ask what might
have happened had the injured man or the one who helped him yielded to
anger or a thirst for revenge. Jesus trusts in the best of the human
spirit; with this parable, he encourages us to persevere in love, to
restore dignity to the suffering and to build a society worthy of the
name.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="The_characters_of_the_story">The characters of the story</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>72. The parable begins with the robbers. Jesus chose to start when
the robbery has already taken place, lest we dwell on the crime itself
or the thieves who committed it. Yet we know them well. We have seen,
descending on our world, the dark shadows of neglect and violence in
the service of petty interests of power, gain and division. The real
question is this: will we abandon the injured man and run to take
refuge from the violence, or will we pursue the thieves? Will the
wounded man end up being the justification for our irreconcilable
divisions, our cruel indifference, our intestine conflicts?</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>73. The parable then asks us to take a closer look at the
passers-by. The nervous indifference that makes them pass to the other
side of the road – whether innocently or not, whether the result of
disdain or mere distraction – makes the priest and the Levite a sad
reflection of the growing gulf between ourselves and the world around
us. There are many ways to pass by at a safe distance: we can retreat
inwards, ignore others, or be indifferent to their plight. Or simply
look elsewhere, as in some countries, or certain sectors of them, where
contempt is shown for the poor and their culture, and one looks the
other way, as if a development plan imported from without could edge
them out. This is how some justify their indifference: the poor, whose
pleas for help might touch their hearts, simply do not exist. The poor
are beyond the scope of their interest.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>74. One detail about the passers-by does stand out: they were
religious, devoted to the worship of God: a priest and a Levite. This
detail should not be overlooked. It shows that belief in God and the
worship of God are not enough to ensure that we are actually living in
a way pleasing to God. A believer may be untrue to everything that his
faith demands of him, and yet think he is close to God and better than
others. The guarantee of an authentic openness to God, on the other
hand, is a way of practising the faith that helps open our hearts to
our brothers and sisters. Saint John Chrysostom expressed this
pointedly when he challenged his Christian hearers: “Do you wish to
honour the body of the Saviour? Do not despise it when it is naked. Do
not honour it in church with silk vestments while outside it is naked
and numb with cold”.<a name="_ftnref58" title="" href="#_ftn58">[58]</a> Paradoxically, those who claim to be unbelievers can sometimes put God’s will into practice better than believers.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>75. “Robbers” usually find secret allies in those who “pass by and
look the other way”. There is a certain interplay between those who
manipulate and cheat society, and those who, while claiming to be
detached and impartial critics, live off that system and its benefits.
There is a sad hypocrisy when the impunity of crime, the use of
institutions for personal or corporate gain, and other evils apparently
impossible to eradicate, are accompanied by a relentless criticism of
everything, a constant sowing of suspicion that results in distrust and
confusion. The complaint that “everything is broken” is answered by the
claim that “it can’t be fixed”, or “what can I do?” This feeds into
disillusionment and despair, and hardly encourages a spirit of
solidarity and generosity. Plunging people into despair closes a
perfectly perverse circle: such is the agenda of the invisible
dictatorship of hidden interests that have gained mastery over both
resources and the possibility of thinking and expressing opinions.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>76. Let us turn at last to the injured man. There are times when we
feel like him, badly hurt and left on side of the road. We can also
feel helpless because our institutions are neglected and lack
resources, or simply serve the interests of a few, without and within.
Indeed, “globalized society often has an elegant way of shifting its
gaze. Under the guise of being politically correct or ideologically
fashionable, we look at those who suffer without touching them. We
televise live pictures of them, even speaking about them with
euphemisms and with apparent tolerance”.<a name="_ftnref59" title="" href="#_ftn59">[59]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Starting_anew_">Starting anew</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>77. Each day offers us a new opportunity, a new possibility. We
should not expect everything from those who govern us, for that would
be childish. We have the space we need for co-responsibility in
creating and putting into place new processes and changes. Let us take
an active part in renewing and supporting our troubled societies. Today
we have a great opportunity to express our innate sense of fraternity,
to be Good Samaritans who bear the pain of other people’s troubles
rather than fomenting greater hatred and resentment. Like the chance
traveller in the parable, we need only have a pure and simple desire to
be a people, a community, constant and tireless in the effort to
include, integrate and lift up the fallen. We may often find ourselves
succumbing to the mentality of the violent, the blindly ambitious,
those who spread mistrust and lies. Others may continue to view
politics or the economy as an arena for their own power plays. For our
part, let us foster what is good and place ourselves at its service.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>78. We can start from below and, case by case, act at the most
concrete and local levels, and then expand to the farthest reaches of
our countries and our world, with the same care and concern that the
Samaritan showed for each of the wounded man’s injuries. Let us seek
out others and embrace the world as it is, without fear of pain or a
sense of inadequacy, because there we will discover all the goodness
that God has planted in human hearts. Difficulties that seem
overwhelming are opportunities for growth, not excuses for a glum
resignation that can lead only to acquiescence. Yet let us not do this
alone, as individuals. The Samaritan discovered an innkeeper who would
care for the man; we too are called to unite as a family that is
stronger than the sum of small individual members. For “the whole is
greater than the part, but it is also greater than the sum of its
parts”.<a name="_ftnref60" title="" href="#_ftn60">[60]</a> Let us
renounce the pettiness and resentment of useless in-fighting and
constant confrontation. Let us stop feeling sorry for ourselves and
acknowledge our crimes, our apathy, our lies. Reparation and
reconciliation will give us new life and set us all free from fear.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>79. The Samaritan who stopped along the way departed without
expecting any recognition or gratitude. His effort to assist another
person gave him great satisfaction in life and before his God, and thus
became a duty. All of us have a responsibility for the wounded, those
of our own people and all the peoples of the earth. Let us care for the
needs of every man and woman, young and old, with the same fraternal
spirit of care and closeness that marked the Good Samaritan.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Neighbours_without_borders_">Neighbours without borders</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>80. Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan in answer to the
question: Who is my neighbour? The word “neighbour”, in the society of
Jesus’ time, usually meant those nearest us. It was felt that help
should be given primarily to those of one’s own group and race. For
some Jews of that time, Samaritans were looked down upon, considered
impure. They were not among those to be helped. Jesus, himself a Jew,
completely transforms this approach. He asks us not to decide who is
close enough to be our neighbour, but rather that we ourselves become
neighbours to all.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>81. Jesus asks us to be present to those in need of help, regardless
of whether or not they belong to our social group. In this case, the
Samaritan <i> became a neighbour</i> to the wounded Judean. By
approaching and making himself present, he crossed all cultural and
historical barriers. Jesus concludes the parable by saying: “Go and do
likewise” (<i>Lk</i> 10:37). In other words, he challenges us to put
aside all differences and, in the face of suffering, to draw near to
others with no questions asked. I should no longer say that I have
neighbours to help, but that I must myself be a neighbour to others.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>82. The parable, though, is troubling, for Jesus says that that the
wounded man was a Judean, while the one who stopped and helped him was
a Samaritan. This detail is quite significant for our reflection on a
love that includes everyone. The Samaritans lived in a region where
pagan rites were practised. For the Jews, this made them impure,
detestable, dangerous. In fact, one ancient Jewish text referring to
nations that were hated, speaks of Samaria as “not even a people” (<i>Sir</i> 50:25); it also refers to “the foolish people that live in Shechem” (50:26).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>83. This explains why a Samaritan woman, when asked by Jesus for a
drink, answered curtly: “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me,
a woman of Samaria?” (<i>Jn</i> 4:9). The most offensive charge that
those who sought to discredit Jesus could bring was that he was
“possessed” and “a Samaritan” (<i>Jn</i> 8:48). So this encounter of
mercy between a Samaritan and a Jew is highly provocative; it leaves no
room for ideological manipulation and challenges us to expand our
frontiers. It gives a universal dimension to our call to love, one that
transcends all prejudices, all historical and cultural barriers, all
petty interests.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="The_plea_of_the_stranger__">The plea of the stranger </a> </i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>84. Finally, I would note that in another passage of the Gospel Jesus says: “I was a stranger and you welcomed me” (<i>Mt</i>
25:35). Jesus could speak those words because he had an open heart,
sensitive to the difficulties of others. Saint Paul urges us to
“rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep” (<i>Rom</i>
12:15). When our hearts do this, they are capable of identifying with
others without worrying about where they were born or come from. In the
process, we come to experience others as our “own flesh” (<i>Is</i> 58:7).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>85. For Christians, the words of Jesus have an even deeper meaning.
They compel us to recognize Christ himself in each of our abandoned or
excluded brothers and sisters (cf. <i>Mt</i><a name="_ftnref61" title="" href="#_ftn61">[61]</a>
We likewise believe that Christ shed his blood for each of us and that
no one is beyond the scope of his universal love. If we go to the
ultimate source of that love which is the very life of the triune God,
we encounter in the community of the three divine Persons the origin
and perfect model of all life in society. Theology continues to be
enriched by its reflection on this great truth. 25:40.45). Faith has
untold power to inspire and sustain our respect for others, for
believers come to know that God loves every man and woman with infinite
love and “thereby confers infinite dignity” upon all humanity.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>86. I sometimes wonder why, in light of this, it took so long for
the Church unequivocally to condemn slavery and various forms of
violence. Today, with our developed spirituality and theology, we have
no excuses. Still, there are those who appear to feel encouraged or at
least permitted by their faith to support varieties of narrow and
violent nationalism, xenophobia and contempt, and even the mistreatment
of those who are different. Faith, and the humanism it inspires, must
maintain a critical sense in the face of these tendencies, and prompt
an immediate response whenever they rear their head. For this reason,
it is important that catechesis and preaching speak more directly and
clearly about the social meaning of existence, the fraternal dimension
of spirituality, our conviction of the inalienable dignity of each
person, and our reasons for loving and accepting all our brothers and
sisters.</big></font></big></p><big>

Nor can they fully know themselves apart from an encounter with other
persons: “I communicate effectively with myself only insofar as I
communicate with others”.<a name="_ftnref63" title="" href="#_ftn63">[63]</a>
No one can experience the true beauty of life without relating to
others, without having real faces to love. This is part of the mystery
of authentic human existence. “Life exists where there is bonding,
communion, fraternity; and life is stronger than death when it is built
on true relationships and bonds of fidelity. On the contrary, there is
no life when we claim to be self-sufficient and live as islands: in
these attitudes, death prevails”.<a name="_ftnref64" title="" href="#_ftn64">[64]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>88. In the depths of every heart, love creates bonds and expands
existence, for it draws people out of themselves and towards others.<a name="_ftnref65" title="" href="#_ftn65">[65]</a> Since we were made for love, in each one of us “a law of <i>ekstasis</i>” seems to operate: “the lover ‘goes outside’ the self to find a fuller existence in another”.<a name="_ftnref66" title="" href="#_ftn66">[66]</a> For this reason, “man always has to take up the challenge of moving beyond himself”.<a name="_ftnref67" title="" href="#_ftn67">[67]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>89. Nor can I reduce my life to relationships with a small group,
even my own family; I cannot know myself apart from a broader network
of relationships, including those that have preceded me and shaped my
entire life. My relationship with those whom I respect has to take
account of the fact that they do not live only for me, nor do I live
only for them. Our relationships, if healthy and authentic, open us to
others who expand and enrich us. Nowadays, our noblest social instincts
can easily be thwarted by self-centred chats that give the impression
of being deep relationships. On the contrary, authentic and mature love
and true friendship can only take root in hearts open to growth through
relationships with others. As couples or friends, we find that our
hearts expand as we step out of ourselves and embrace others. Closed
groups and self-absorbed couples that define themselves in opposition
to others tend to be expressions of selfishness and mere
self-preservation.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>90. Significantly, many small communities living in desert areas
developed a remarkable system of welcoming pilgrims as an exercise of
the sacred duty of hospitality. The medieval monastic communities did
likewise, as we see from the Rule of Saint Benedict. While
acknowledging that it might detract from the discipline and silence of
monasteries, Benedict nonetheless insisted that “the poor and pilgrims
be treated with the utmost care and attention”.<a name="_ftnref68" title="" href="#_ftn68">[68]</a>
Hospitality was one specific way of rising to the challenge and the
gift present in an encounter with those outside one’s own circle. The
monks realized that the values they sought to cultivate had to be
accompanied by a readiness to move beyond themselves in openness to
others.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>91. People can develop certain habits that might appear as moral
values: fortitude, sobriety, hard work and similar virtues. Yet if the
acts of the various moral virtues are to be rightly directed, one needs
to take into account the extent to which they foster openness and union
with others. That is made possible by the charity that God infuses.
Without charity, we may perhaps possess only apparent virtues,
incapable of sustaining life in common. Thus, Saint Thomas Aquinas
could say – quoting Saint Augustine – that the temperance of a greedy
person is in no way virtuous.<a name="_ftnref69" title="" href="#_ftn69">[69]</a>
Saint Bonaventure, for his part, explained that the other virtues,
without charity, strictly speaking do not fulfil the commandments “the
way God wants them to be fulfilled”.<a name="_ftnref70" title="" href="#_ftn70">[70]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>92. The spiritual stature of a person’s life is measured by love,
which in the end remains “the criterion for the definitive decision
about a human life’s worth or lack thereof”.<a name="_ftnref71" title="" href="#_ftn71">[71]</a>
Yet some believers think that it consists in the imposition of their
own ideologies upon everyone else, or in a violent defence of the
truth, or in impressive demonstrations of strength. All of us, as
believers, need to recognize that love takes first place: love must
never be put at risk, and the greatest danger lies in failing to love
(cf. <i>1 Cor</i> 13:1-13).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>93. Saint Thomas Aquinas sought to describe the love made possible
by God’s grace as a movement outwards towards another, whereby we
consider “the beloved as somehow united to ourselves”.<a name="_ftnref72" title="" href="#_ftn72">[72]</a>
Our affection for others makes us freely desire to seek their good. All
this originates in a sense of esteem, an appreciation of the value of
the other. This is ultimately the idea behind the word “charity”: those
who are loved are “dear” to me; “they are considered of great value”.<a name="_ftnref73" title="" href="#_ftn73">[73]</a> And “the love whereby someone becomes pleasing (<i>grata</i>) to another is the reason why the latter bestows something on him freely (<i>gratis</i>)”.<a name="_ftnref74" title="" href="#_ftn74">[74]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>94. Love, then, is more than just a series of benevolent actions.
Those actions have their source in a union increasingly directed
towards others, considering them of value, worthy, pleasing and
beautiful apart from their physical or moral appearances. Our love for
others, for who they <i>are</i>, moves us to seek the best for their
lives. Only by cultivating this way of relating to one another will we
make possible a social friendship that excludes no one and a fraternity
that is open to all.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>95. Love also impels us towards universal communion. No one can
mature or find fulfilment by withdrawing from others. By its very
nature, love calls for growth in openness and the ability to accept
others as part of a continuing adventure that makes every periphery
converge in a greater sense of mutual belonging. As Jesus told us: “You
are all brothers” (<i>Mt</i> 23:8).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>96. This need to transcend our own limitations also applies to
different regions and countries. Indeed, “the ever-increasing number of
interconnections and communications in today’s world makes us
powerfully aware of the unity and common destiny of the nations. In the
dynamics of history, and in the diversity of ethnic groups, societies
and cultures, we see the seeds of a vocation to form a community
composed of brothers and sisters who accept and care for one another”.<a name="_ftnref75" title="" href="#_ftn75">[75]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Open_societies_that_integrate_everyone">Open societies that integrate everyone</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>97. Some peripheries are close to us, in city centres or within our
families. Hence there is an aspect of universal openness in love that
is existential rather than geographical. It has to do with our daily
efforts to expand our circle of friends, to reach those who, even
though they are close to me, I do not naturally consider a part of my
circle of interests. Every brother or sister in need, when abandoned or
ignored by the society in which I live, becomes an existential
foreigner, even though born in the same country. They may be citizens
with full rights, yet they are treated like foreigners in their own
country. Racism is a virus that quickly mutates and, instead of
disappearing, goes into hiding, and lurks in waiting.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>98. I would like to mention some of those “hidden exiles” who are treated as foreign bodies in society.<a name="_ftnref76" title="" href="#_ftn76">[76]</a>
Many persons with disabilities “feel that they exist without belonging
and without participating”. Much still prevents them from being fully
enfranchised. Our concern should be not only to care for them but to
ensure their “active participation in the civil and ecclesial
community. That is a demanding and even tiring process, yet one that
will gradually contribute to the formation of consciences capable of
acknowledging each individual as a unique and unrepeatable person”. I
think, too, of “the elderly who, also due to their disability, are
sometimes considered a burden”. Yet each of them is able to offer “a
unique contribution to the common good through their remarkable life
stories”. Let me repeat: we need to have “the courage to give a voice
to those who are discriminated against due to their disability, because
sadly, in some countries even today, people find it hard to acknowledge
them as persons of equal dignity”.<a name="_ftnref77" title="" href="#_ftn77">[77]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>99. A love capable of transcending borders is the basis of what in
every city and country can be called “social friendship”. Genuine
social friendship within a society makes true universal openness
possible. This is a far cry from the false universalism of those who
constantly travel abroad because they cannot tolerate or love their own
people. Those who look down on their own people tend to create within
society categories of first and second class, people of greater or
lesser dignity, people enjoying greater or fewer rights. In this way,
they deny that there is room for everybody.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>100. I am certainly not proposing an authoritarian and abstract
universalism, devised or planned by a small group and presented as an
ideal for the sake of levelling, dominating and plundering. One model
of globalization in fact “consciously aims at a one-dimensional
uniformity and seeks to eliminate all differences and traditions in a
superficial quest for unity… If a certain kind of globalization claims
to make everyone uniform, to level everyone out, that globalization
destroys the rich gifts and uniqueness of each person and each people”.<a name="_ftnref78" title="" href="#_ftn78">[78]</a>
This false universalism ends up depriving the world of its various
colours, its beauty and, ultimately, its humanity. For “the future is
not monochrome; if we are courageous, we can contemplate it in all the
variety and diversity of what each individual person has to offer. How
much our human family needs to learn to live together in harmony and
peace, without all of us having to be the same!”<a name="_ftnref79" title="" href="#_ftn79">[79]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>101. Let us now return to the parable of the Good Samaritan, for it
still has much to say to us. An injured man lay on the roadside. The
people walking by him did not heed their interior summons to act as
neighbours; they were concerned with their duties, their social status,
their professional position within society. They considered themselves
important for the society of the time, and were anxious to play their
proper part. The man on the roadside, bruised and abandoned, was a
distraction, an interruption from all that; in any event, he was hardly
important. He was a “nobody”, undistinguished, irrelevant to their
plans for the future. The Good Samaritan transcended these narrow
classifications. He himself did not fit into any of those categories;
he was simply a foreigner without a place in society. Free of every
label and position, he was able to interrupt his journey, change his
plans, and unexpectedly come to the aid of an injured person who needed
his help.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>102. What would be the reaction to that same story nowadays, in a
world that constantly witnesses the emergence and growth of social
groups clinging to an identity that separates them from others? How
would it affect those who organize themselves in a way that prevents
any foreign presence that might threaten their identity and their
closed and self-referential structures? There, even the possibility of
acting as a neighbour is excluded; one is a neighbour only to those who
serve their purpose. The word “neighbour” loses all meaning; there can
only be “associates”, partners in the pursuit of particular interests.<a name="_ftnref80" title="" href="#_ftn80">[80]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Liberty,_equality_and_fraternity_">Liberty, equality and fraternity</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>103. Fraternity is born not only of a climate of respect for
individual liberties, or even of a certain administratively guaranteed
equality. Fraternity necessarily calls for something greater, which in
turn enhances freedom and equality. What happens when fraternity is not
consciously cultivated, when there is a lack of political will to
promote it through education in fraternity, through dialogue and
through the recognition of the values of reciprocity and mutual
enrichment? Liberty becomes nothing more than a condition for living as
we will, completely free to choose to whom or what we will belong, or
simply to possess or exploit. This shallow understanding has little to
do with the richness of a liberty directed above all to love.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>104. Nor is equality achieved by an abstract proclamation that “all
men and women are equal”. Instead, it is the result of the conscious
and careful cultivation of fraternity. Those capable only of being
“associates” create closed worlds. Within that framework, what place is
there for those who are not part of one’s group of associates, yet long
for a better life for themselves and their families?</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>105. Individualism does not make us more free, more equal, more
fraternal. The mere sum of individual interests is not capable of
generating a better world for the whole human family. Nor can it save
us from the many ills that are now increasingly globalized. Radical
individualism is a virus that is extremely difficult to eliminate, for
it is clever. It makes us believe that everything consists in giving
free rein to our own ambitions, as if by pursuing ever greater
ambitions and creating safety nets we would somehow be serving the
common good.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="A_UNIVERSAL_LOVE_THAT_PROMOTES_PERSONS">A UNIVERSAL LOVE THAT PROMOTES PERSONS</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>106. Social friendship and universal fraternity necessarily call for an acknowledgement of <i>the worth of every human person</i>,
always and everywhere. If each individual is of such great worth, it
must be stated clearly and firmly that “the mere fact that some people
are born in places with fewer resources or less development does not
justify the fact that they are living with less dignity”.<a name="_ftnref81" title="" href="#_ftn81">[81]</a>
This is a basic principle of social life that tends to be ignored in a
variety of ways by those who sense that it does not fit into their
worldview or serve their purposes.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>107. Every human being has the right to live with dignity and to
develop integrally; this fundamental right cannot be denied by any
country. People have this right even if they are unproductive, or were
born with or developed limitations. This does not detract from their
great dignity as human persons, a dignity based not on circumstances
but on the intrinsic worth of their being. Unless this basic principle
is upheld, there will be no future either for fraternity or for the
survival of humanity.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>108. Some societies accept this principle in part. They agree that
opportunities should be available to everyone, but then go on to say
that everything depends on the individual. From this skewed
perspective, it would be pointless “to favour an investment in efforts
to help the slow, the weak or the less talented to find opportunities
in life”.<a name="_ftnref82" title="" href="#_ftn82">[82]</a>
Investments in assistance to the vulnerable could prove unprofitable;
they might make things less efficient. No. What we need in fact are
states and civil institutions that are present and active, that look
beyond the free and efficient working of certain economic, political or
ideological systems, and are primarily concerned with individuals and
the common good.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>109. Some people are born into economically stable families, receive
a fine education, grow up well nourished, or naturally possess great
talent. They will certainly not need a proactive state; they need only
claim their freedom. Yet the same rule clearly does not apply to a
disabled person, to someone born in dire poverty, to those lacking a
good education and with little access to adequate health care. If a
society is governed primarily by the criteria of market freedom and
efficiency, there is no place for such persons, and fraternity will
remain just another vague ideal.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>110. Indeed, “to claim economic freedom while real conditions bar
many people from actual access to it, and while possibilities for
employment continue to shrink, is to practise doublespeak”.<a name="_ftnref83" title="" href="#_ftn83">[83]</a>
Words like freedom, democracy or fraternity prove meaningless, for the
fact is that “only when our economic and social system no longer
produces even a single victim, a single person cast aside, will we be
able to celebrate the feast of universal fraternity”.<a name="_ftnref84" title="" href="#_ftn84">[84]</a>
A truly human and fraternal society will be capable of ensuring in an
efficient and stable way that each of its members is accompanied at
every stage of life. Not only by providing for their basic needs, but
by enabling them to give the best of themselves, even though their
performance may be less than optimum, their pace slow or their
efficiency limited.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>111. The human person, with his or her inalienable rights, is by
nature open to relationship. Implanted deep within us is the call to
transcend ourselves through an encounter with others. For this reason,
“care must be taken not to fall into certain errors which can arise
from a misunderstanding of the concept of human rights and from its
misuse. Today there is a tendency to claim ever broader individual – I
am tempted to say individualistic – rights. Underlying this is a
conception of the human person as detached from all social and
anthropological contexts, as if the person were a “monad” (<i>monás</i>),
increasingly unconcerned with others… Unless the rights of each
individual are harmoniously ordered to the greater good, those rights
will end up being considered limitless and consequently will become a
source of conflicts and violence”.<a name="_ftnref85" title="" href="#_ftn85">[85]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>112. Nor can we fail to mention that seeking and pursuing the good
of others and of the entire human family also implies helping
individuals and societies to mature in the moral values that foster
integral human development. The New Testament describes one fruit of
the Holy Spirit (cf. <i>Gal</i> 5:22) as <i> agathosyne</i>; the Greek
word expresses attachment to the good, pursuit of the good. Even more,
it suggests a striving for excellence and what is best for others,
their growth in maturity and health, the cultivation of values and not
simply material wellbeing. A similar expression exists in Latin: <i> benevolentia</i>.
This is an attitude that “wills the good” of others; it bespeaks a
yearning for goodness, an inclination towards all that is fine and
excellent, a desire to fill the lives of others with what is beautiful,
sublime and edifying.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>113. Here, regrettably, I feel bound to reiterate that “we have had
enough of immorality and the mockery of ethics, goodness, faith and
honesty. It is time to acknowledge that light-hearted superficiality
has done us no good. Once the foundations of social life are corroded,
what ensues are battles over conflicting interests”.<a name="_ftnref86" title="" href="#_ftn86">[86]</a>
Let us return to promoting the good, for ourselves and for the whole
human family, and thus advance together towards an authentic and
integral growth. Every society needs to ensure that values are passed
on; otherwise, what is handed down are selfishness, violence,
corruption in its various forms, indifference and, ultimately, a life
closed to transcendence and entrenched in individual interests.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="The_value_of_solidarity">The value of solidarity</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>114. I would like especially to mention solidarity, which, “as a
moral virtue and social attitude born of personal conversion, calls for
commitment on the part of those responsible for education and
formation. I think first of families, called to a primary and vital
mission of education. Families are the first place where the values of
love and fraternity, togetherness and sharing, concern and care for
others are lived out and handed on. They are also the privileged milieu
for transmitting the faith, beginning with those first simple gestures
of devotion which mothers teach their children. Teachers, who have the
challenging task of training children and youth in schools or other
settings, should be conscious that their responsibility extends also to
the moral, spiritual and social aspects of life. The values of freedom,
mutual respect and solidarity can be handed on from a tender age…
Communicators also have a responsibility for education and formation,
especially nowadays, when the means of information and communication
are so widespread”.<a name="_ftnref87" title="" href="#_ftn87">[87]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>115. At a time when everything seems to disintegrate and lose consistency, it is good for us to appeal to the “solidity”<a name="_ftnref88" title="" href="#_ftn88">[88]</a>
born of the consciousness that we are responsible for the fragility of
others as we strive to build a common future. Solidarity finds concrete
expression in service, which can take a variety of forms in an effort
to care for others. And service in great part means “caring for
vulnerability, for the vulnerable members of our families, our society,
our people”. In offering such service, individuals learn to “set aside
their own wishes and desires, their pursuit of power, before the
concrete gaze of those who are most vulnerable… Service always looks to
their faces, touches their flesh, senses their closeness and even, in
some cases, ‘suffers’ that closeness and tries to help them. Service is
never ideological, for we do not serve ideas, we serve people”.<a name="_ftnref89" title="" href="#_ftn89">[89]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>116. The needy generally “practise the special solidarity that
exists among those who are poor and suffering, and which our
civilization seems to have forgotten or would prefer in fact to forget.
Solidarity is a word that is not always well received; in certain
situations, it has become a dirty word, a word that dare not be said.
Solidarity means much more than engaging in sporadic acts of
generosity. It means thinking and acting in terms of community. It
means that the lives of all are prior to the appropriation of goods by
a few. It also means combatting the structural causes of poverty,
inequality, the lack of work, land and housing, the denial of social
and labour rights. It means confronting the destructive effects of the
empire of money… Solidarity, understood in its most profound meaning,
is a way of making history, and this is what popular movements are
doing”.<a name="_ftnref90" title="" href="#_ftn90">[90]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>117. When we speak of the need to care for our common home, our
planet, we appeal to that spark of universal consciousness and mutual
concern that may still be present in people’s hearts. Those who enjoy a
surplus of water yet choose to conserve it for the sake of the greater
human family have attained a moral stature that allows them to look
beyond themselves and the group to which they belong. How marvellously
human! The same attitude is demanded if we are to recognize the rights
of all people, even those born beyond our own borders.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>118. The world exists for everyone, because all of us were born with
the same dignity. Differences of colour, religion, talent, place of
birth or residence, and so many others, cannot be used to justify the
privileges of some over the rights of all. As a community, we have an
obligation to ensure that every person lives with dignity and has
sufficient opportunities for his or her integral development.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>119. In the first Christian centuries, a number of thinkers
developed a universal vision in their reflections on the common
destination of created goods.<a name="_ftnref91" title="" href="#_ftn91">[91]</a>
This led them to realize that if one person lacks what is necessary to
live with dignity, it is because another person is detaining it. Saint
John Chrysostom summarizes it in this way: “Not to share our wealth
with the poor is to rob them and take away their livelihood. The riches
we possess are not our own, but theirs as well”.<a name="_ftnref92" title="" href="#_ftn92">[92]</a>
In the words of Saint Gregory the Great, “When we provide the needy
with their basic needs, we are giving them what belongs to them, not to
us”.<a name="_ftnref93" title="" href="#_ftn93">[93]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>120. Once more, I would like to echo a statement of Saint John Paul
II whose forcefulness has perhaps been insufficiently recognized: “God
gave the earth to the whole human race for the sustenance of all its
members, without excluding or favouring anyone”.<a name="_ftnref94" title="" href="#_ftn94">[94]</a>
For my part, I would observe that “the Christian tradition has never
recognized the right to private property as absolute or inviolable, and
has stressed the social purpose of all forms of private property”.<a name="_ftnref95" title="" href="#_ftn95">[95]</a> The principle of the common use of created goods is the “first principle of the whole ethical and social order”;<a name="_ftnref96" title="" href="#_ftn96">[96]</a> it is a natural and inherent right that takes priority over others.<a name="_ftnref97" title="" href="#_ftn97">[97]</a>
All other rights having to do with the goods necessary for the integral
fulfilment of persons, including that of private property or any other
type of property, should – in the words of Saint Paul VI – “in no way
hinder [this right], but should actively facilitate its implementation”.<a name="_ftnref98" title="" href="#_ftn98">[98]</a>
The right to private property can only be considered a secondary
natural right, derived from the principle of the universal destination
of created goods. This has concrete consequences that ought to be
reflected in the workings of society. Yet it often happens that
secondary rights displace primary and overriding rights, in practice
making them irrelevant.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>121. No one, then, can remain excluded because of his or her place
of birth, much less because of privileges enjoyed by others who were
born in lands of greater opportunity. The limits and borders of
individual states cannot stand in the way of this. As it is
unacceptable that some have fewer rights by virtue of being women, it
is likewise unacceptable that the mere place of one’s birth or
residence should result in his or her possessing fewer opportunities
for a developed and dignified life.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>122. Development must not aim at the amassing of wealth by a few,
but must ensure “human rights – personal and social, economic and
political, including the rights of nations and of peoples”.<a name="_ftnref99" title="" href="#_ftn99">[99]</a>
The right of some to free enterprise or market freedom cannot supersede
the rights of peoples and the dignity of the poor, or, for that matter,
respect for the natural environment, for “if we make something our own,
it is only to administer it for the good of all”.<a name="_ftnref100" title="" href="#_ftn100">[100]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>123. Business activity is essentially “a noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving our world”.<a name="_ftnref101" title="" href="#_ftn101">[101]</a>
God encourages us to develop the talents he gave us, and he has made
our universe one of immense potential. In God’s plan, each individual
is called to promote his or her own development,<a name="_ftnref102" title="" href="#_ftn102">[102]</a>
and this includes finding the best economic and technological means of
multiplying goods and increasing wealth. Business abilities, which are
a gift from God, should always be clearly directed to the development
of others and to eliminating poverty, especially through the creation
of diversified work opportunities. The right to private property is
always accompanied by the primary and prior principle of the
subordination of all private property to the universal destination of
the earth’s goods, and thus the right of all to their use.<a name="_ftnref103" title="" href="#_ftn103">[103]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>124. Nowadays, a firm belief in the common destination of the
earth’s goods requires that this principle also be applied to nations,
their territories and their resources. Seen from the standpoint not
only of the legitimacy of private property and the rights of its
citizens, but also of the first principle of the common destination of
goods, we can then say that each country also belongs to the foreigner,
inasmuch as a territory’s goods must not be denied to a needy person
coming from elsewhere. As the Bishops of the United States have taught,
there are fundamental rights that “precede any society because they
flow from the dignity granted to each person as created by God”.<a name="_ftnref104" title="" href="#_ftn104">[104]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>125. This presupposes a different way of understanding relations and
exchanges between countries. If every human being possesses an
inalienable dignity, if all people are my brothers and sisters, and if
the world truly belongs to everyone, then it matters little whether my
neighbour was born in my country or elsewhere. My own country also
shares responsibility for his or her development, although it can
fulfil that responsibility in a variety of ways. It can offer a
generous welcome to those in urgent need, or work to improve living
conditions in their native lands by refusing to exploit those countries
or to drain them of natural resources, backing corrupt systems that
hinder the dignified development of their peoples. What applies to
nations is true also for different regions within each country, since
there too great inequalities often exist. At times, the inability to
recognize equal human dignity leads the more developed regions in some
countries to think that they can jettison the “dead weight” of poorer
regions and so increase their level of consumption.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>126. We are really speaking about a new network of international
relations, since there is no way to resolve the serious problems of our
world if we continue to think only in terms of mutual assistance
between individuals or small groups. Nor should we forget that
“inequity affects not only individuals but entire countries; it compels
us to consider an ethics of international relations”.<a name="_ftnref105" title="" href="#_ftn105">[105]</a>
Indeed, justice requires recognizing and respecting not only the rights
of individuals, but also social rights and the rights of peoples.<a name="_ftnref106" title="" href="#_ftn106">[106]</a> This means finding a way to ensure “the fundamental right of peoples to subsistence and progress”,<a name="_ftnref107" title="" href="#_ftn107">[107]</a>
a right which is at times severely restricted by the pressure created
by foreign debt. In many instances, debt repayment not only fails to
promote development but gravely limits and conditions it. While
respecting the principle that all legitimately acquired debt must be
repaid, the way in which many poor countries fulfil this obligation
should not end up compromising their very existence and growth.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>127. Certainly, all this calls for an alternative way of thinking.
Without an attempt to enter into that way of thinking, what I am saying
here will sound wildly unrealistic. On the other hand, if we accept the
great principle that there are rights born of our inalienable human
dignity, we can rise to the challenge of envisaging a new humanity. We
can aspire to a world that provides land, housing and work for all.
This is the true path of peace, not the senseless and myopic strategy
of sowing fear and mistrust in the face of outside threats. For a real
and lasting peace will only be possible “on the basis of a global ethic
of solidarity and cooperation in the service of a future shaped by
interdependence and shared responsibility in the whole human family”.<a name="_ftnref108" title="" href="#_ftn108">[108]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

sisters is not to remain an abstract idea but to find concrete
embodiment, then numerous related issues emerge, forcing us to see
things in a new light and to develop new responses. </big></font></big></p><big>

Ideally, unnecessary migration ought to be avoided; this entails
creating in countries of origin the conditions needed for a dignified
life and integral development. Yet until substantial progress is made
in achieving this goal, we are obliged to respect the right of all
individuals to find a place that meets their basic needs and those of
their families, and where they can find personal fulfilment. Our
response to the arrival of migrating persons can be summarized by four
words: welcome, protect, promote and integrate. For “it is not a case
of implementing welfare programmes from the top down, but rather of
undertaking a journey together, through these four actions, in order to
build cities and countries that, while preserving their respective
cultural and religious identity, are open to differences and know how
to promote them in the spirit of human fraternity”.<a name="_ftnref110" title="" href="#_ftn110">[110]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>130. This implies taking certain indispensable steps, especially in
response to those who are fleeing grave humanitarian crises. As
examples, we may cite: increasing and simplifying the granting of
visas; adopting programmes of individual and community sponsorship;
opening humanitarian corridors for the most vulnerable refugees;
providing suitable and dignified housing; guaranteeing personal
security and access to basic services; ensuring adequate consular
assistance and the right to retain personal identity documents;
equitable access to the justice system; the possibility of opening bank
accounts and the guarantee of the minimum needed to survive; freedom of
movement and the possibility of employment; protecting minors and
ensuring their regular access to education; providing for programmes of
temporary guardianship or shelter; guaranteeing religious freedom;
promoting integration into society; supporting the reuniting of
families; and preparing local communities for the process of
integration.<a name="_ftnref111" title="" href="#_ftn111">[111]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>131. For those who are not recent arrivals and already participate
in the fabric of society, it is important to apply the concept of
“citizenship”, which “is based on the equality of rights and duties,
under which all enjoy justice. It is therefore crucial to establish in
our societies the concept of <i>full citizenship </i>and to reject the discriminatory use of the term <i>minorities</i>,
which engenders feelings of isolation and inferiority. Its misuse paves
the way for hostility and discord; it undoes any successes and takes
away the religious and civil rights of some citizens who are thus
discriminated against”.<a name="_ftnref112" title="" href="#_ftn112">[112]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>132. Even when they take such essential steps, states are not able,
on their own, to implement adequate solutions, “since the consequences
of the decisions made by each inevitably have repercussions on the
entire international community”. As a result, “our response can only be
the fruit of a common effort”<a name="_ftnref113" title="" href="#_ftn113">[113]</a>
to develop a form of global governance with regard to movements of
migration. Thus, there is “a need for mid-term and long-term planning
which is not limited to emergency responses. Such planning should
include effective assistance for integrating migrants in their
receiving countries, while also promoting the development of their
countries of origin through policies inspired by solidarity, yet not
linking assistance to ideological strategies and practices alien or
contrary to the cultures of the peoples being assisted”.<a name="_ftnref114" title="" href="#_ftn114">[114]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="RECIPROCAL_GIFTS">RECIPROCAL GIFTS</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>133. The arrival of those who are different, coming from other ways
of life and cultures, can be a gift, for “the stories of migrants are
always stories of an encounter between individuals and between
cultures. For the communities and societies to which they come,
migrants bring an opportunity for enrichment and the integral human
development of all”.<a name="_ftnref115" title="" href="#_ftn115">[115]</a>
For this reason, “I especially urge young people not to play into the
hands of those who would set them against other young people, newly
arrived in their countries, and who would encourage them to view the
latter as a threat, and not possessed of the same inalienable dignity
as every other human being”.<a name="_ftnref116" title="" href="#_ftn116">[116]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>134. Indeed, when we open our hearts to those who are different,
this enables them, while continuing to be themselves, to develop in new
ways. The different cultures that have flourished over the centuries
need to be preserved, lest our world be impoverished. At the same time,
those cultures should be encouraged to be open to new experiences
through their encounter with other realities, for the risk of
succumbing to cultural sclerosis is always present. That is why “we
need to communicate with each other, to discover the gifts of each
person, to promote that which unites us, and to regard our differences
as an opportunity to grow in mutual respect. Patience and trust are
called for in such dialogue, permitting individuals, families and
communities to hand on the values of their own culture and welcome the
good that comes from others’ experiences”.<a name="_ftnref117" title="" href="#_ftn117">[117]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>135. Here I would mention some examples that I have used in the
past. Latino culture is “a ferment of values and possibilities that can
greatly enrich the United States”, for “intense immigration always ends
up influencing and transforming the culture of a place… In Argentina,
intense immigration from Italy has left a mark on the culture of the
society, and the presence of some 200,000 Jews has a great effect on
the cultural ‘style’ of Buenos Aires. Immigrants, if they are helped to
integrate, are a blessing, a source of enrichment and new gift that
encourages a society to grow”.<a name="_ftnref118" title="" href="#_ftn118">[118]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>136. On an even broader scale, Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb and I have
observed that “good relations between East and West are indisputably
necessary for both. They must not be neglected, so that each can be
enriched by the other’s culture through fruitful exchange and dialogue.
The West can discover in the East remedies for those spiritual and
religious maladies that are caused by a prevailing materialism. And the
East can find in the West many elements that can help free it from
weakness, division, conflict and scientific, technical and cultural
decline. It is important to pay attention to religious, cultural and
historical differences that are a vital component in shaping the
character, culture and civilization of the East. It is likewise
important to reinforce the bond of fundamental human rights in order to
help ensure a dignified life for all the men and women of East and
West, avoiding the politics of double standards”.<a name="_ftnref119" title="" href="#_ftn119">[119]</a></big></font> </big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>137. Mutual assistance between countries proves enriching for each.
A country that moves forward while remaining solidly grounded in its
original cultural substratum is a treasure for the whole of humanity.
We need to develop the awareness that nowadays we are either all saved
together or no one is saved. Poverty, decadence and suffering in one
part of the earth are a silent breeding ground for problems that will
end up affecting the entire planet. If we are troubled by the
extinction of certain species, we should be all the more troubled that
in some parts of our world individuals or peoples are prevented from
developing their potential and beauty by poverty or other structural
limitations. In the end, this will impoverish us all. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>138. Although this has always been true, never has it been more
evident than in our own day, when the world is interconnected by
globalization. We need to attain a global juridical, political and
economic order “which can increase and give direction to international
cooperation for the development of all peoples in solidarity”.<a name="_ftnref120" title="" href="#_ftn120">[120]</a> Ultimately, this will benefit the entire world, since “development aid for poor countries” implies “creating wealth for all”.<a name="_ftnref121" title="" href="#_ftn121">[121]</a>
From the standpoint of integral development, this presupposes “giving
poorer nations an effective voice in shared decision-making”<a name="_ftnref122" title="" href="#_ftn122">[122]</a>
and the capacity to “facilitate access to the international market on
the part of countries suffering from poverty and underdevelopment”.<a name="_ftnref123" title="" href="#_ftn123">[123]</a></big></font> </big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>139. Even so, I do not wish to limit this presentation to a kind of
utilitarian approach. There is always the factor of “gratuitousness”:
the ability to do some things simply because they are good in
themselves, without concern for personal gain or recompense.
Gratuitousness makes it possible for us to welcome the stranger, even
though this brings us no immediate tangible benefit. Some countries,
though, presume to accept only scientists or investors. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>140. Life without fraternal gratuitousness becomes a form of
frenetic commerce, in which we are constantly weighing up what we give
and what we get back in return. God, on the other hand, gives freely,
to the point of helping even those who are unfaithful; he “makes his
sun rise on the evil and on the good” (<i>Mt</i> 5:45). There is a
reason why Jesus told us: “When you give alms, do not let your right
hand know what your left hand is doing, so that your alms may be in
secret” (<i>Mt</i> 6:3-4). We received life freely; we paid nothing for
it. Consequently, all of us are able to give without expecting anything
in return, to do good to others without demanding that they treat us
well in return. As Jesus told his disciples: “Without cost you have
received, without cost you are to give” (<i>Mt</i> 10:8). </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>141. The true worth of the different countries of our world is
measured by their ability to think not simply as a country but also as
part of the larger human family. This is seen especially in times of
crisis. Narrow forms of nationalism are an extreme expression of an
inability to grasp the meaning of this gratuitousness. They err in
thinking that they can develop on their own, heedless of the ruin of
others, that by closing their doors to others they will be better
protected. Immigrants are seen as usurpers who have nothing to offer.
This leads to the simplistic belief that the poor are dangerous and
useless, while the powerful are generous benefactors. Only a social and
political culture that readily and “gratuitously” welcomes others will
have a future. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="LOCAL_AND_UNIVERSAL">LOCAL AND UNIVERSAL</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>142. It should be kept in mind that “an innate tension exists
between globalization and localization. We need to pay attention to the
global so as to avoid narrowness and banality. Yet we also need to look
to the local, which keeps our feet on the ground. Together, the two
prevent us from falling into one of two extremes. In the first, people
get caught up in an abstract, globalized universe… In the other, they
turn into a museum of local folklore, a world apart, doomed to doing
the same things over and over, incapable of being challenged by novelty
or appreciating the beauty which God bestows beyond their borders”.<a name="_ftnref124" title="" href="#_ftn124">[124]</a>
We need to have a global outlook to save ourselves from petty
provincialism. When our house stops being a home and starts to become
an enclosure, a cell, then the global comes to our rescue, like a
“final cause” that draws us towards our fulfilment. At the same time,
though, the local has to be eagerly embraced, for it possesses
something that the global does not: it is capable of being a leaven, of
bringing enrichment, of sparking mechanisms of subsidiarity. Universal
fraternity and social friendship are thus two inseparable and equally
vital poles in every society. To separate them would be to disfigure
each and to create a dangerous polarization. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Local_flavour_">Local flavour</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>143. The solution is not an openness that spurns its own richness.
Just as there can be no dialogue with “others” without a sense of our
own identity, so there can be no openness between peoples except on the
basis of love for one’s own land, one’s own people, one’s own cultural
roots. I cannot truly encounter another unless I stand on firm
foundations, for it is on the basis of these that I can accept the gift
the other brings and in turn offer an authentic gift of my own. I can
welcome others who are different, and value the unique contribution
they have to make, only if I am firmly rooted in my own people and
culture. Everyone loves and cares for his or her native land and
village, just as they love and care for their home and are personally
responsible for its upkeep. The common good likewise requires that we
protect and love our native land. Otherwise, the consequences of a
disaster in one country will end up affecting the entire planet. All
this brings out the positive meaning of the right to property: I care
for and cultivate something that I possess, in such a way that it can
contribute to the good of all. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>144. It also gives rise to healthy and enriching exchanges. The
experience of being raised in a particular place and sharing in a
particular culture gives us insight into aspects of reality that others
cannot so easily perceive. Universal does not necessarily mean bland,
uniform and standardized, based on a single prevailing cultural model,
for this will ultimately lead to the loss of a rich palette of shades
and colours, and result in utter monotony. Such was the temptation
referred to in the ancient account of the Tower of Babel. The attempt
to build a tower that would reach to heaven was not an expression of
unity between various peoples speaking to one another from their
diversity. Instead, it was a misguided attempt, born of pride and
ambition, to create a unity other than that willed by God in his
providential plan for the nations (cf. <i>Gen</i> 11:1-9). </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>145. There can be a false openness to the universal, born of the
shallowness of those lacking insight into the genius of their native
land or harbouring unresolved resentment towards their own people.
Whatever the case, “we constantly have to broaden our horizons and see
the greater good which will benefit us all. But this has to be done
without evasion or uprooting. We need to sink our roots deeper into the
fertile soil and history of our native place, which is a gift of God.
We can work on a small scale, in our own neighbourhood, but with a
larger perspective… The global need not stifle, nor the particular
prove barren”;<a name="_ftnref125" title="" href="#_ftn125">[125]</a>
our model must be that of a polyhedron, in which the value of each
individual is respected, where “the whole is greater than the part, but
it is also greater than the sum of its parts”.<a name="_ftnref126" title="" href="#_ftn126">[126]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>146. There is a kind of “local” narcissism unrelated to a healthy
love of one’s own people and culture. It is born of a certain
insecurity and fear of the other that leads to rejection and the desire
to erect walls for self-defence. Yet it is impossible to be “local” in
a healthy way without being sincerely open to the universal, without
feeling challenged by what is happening in other places, without
openness to enrichment by other cultures, and without solidarity and
concern for the tragedies affecting other peoples. A “local narcissism”
instead frets over a limited number of ideas, customs and forms of
security; incapable of admiring the vast potential and beauty offered
by the larger world, it lacks an authentic and generous spirit of
solidarity. Life on the local level thus becomes less and less
welcoming, people less open to complementarity. Its possibilities for
development narrow; it grows weary and infirm. A healthy culture, on
the other hand, is open and welcoming by its very nature; indeed, “a
culture without universal values is not truly a culture”.<a name="_ftnref127" title="" href="#_ftn127">[127]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>147. Let us realize that as our minds and hearts narrow, the less
capable we become of understanding the world around us. Without
encountering and relating to differences, it is hard to achieve a clear
and complete understanding even of ourselves and of our native land.
Other cultures are not “enemies” from which we need to protect
ourselves, but differing reflections of the inexhaustible richness of
human life. Seeing ourselves from the perspective of another, of one
who is different, we can better recognize our own unique features and
those of our culture: its richness, its possibilities and its
limitations. Our local experience needs to develop “in contrast to” and
“in harmony with” the experiences of others living in diverse cultural
contexts.<a name="_ftnref128" title="" href="#_ftn128">[128]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>148. In fact, a healthy openness never threatens one’s own identity.
A living culture, enriched by elements from other places, does not
import a mere carbon copy of those new elements, but integrates them in
its own unique way. The result is a new synthesis that is ultimately
beneficial to all, since the original culture itself ends up being
nourished. That is why I have urged indigenous peoples to cherish their
roots and their ancestral cultures. At the same time, though, I have
wanted to stress that I have no intention of proposing “a completely
enclosed, a-historic, static ‘indigenism’ that would reject any kind of
blending (<i>mestizaje</i>)”. For “our own cultural identity is
strengthened and enriched as a result of dialogue with those unlike
ourselves. Nor is our authentic identity preserved by an impoverished
isolation”.<a name="_ftnref129" title="" href="#_ftn129">[129]</a> The
world grows and is filled with new beauty, thanks to the successive
syntheses produced between cultures that are open and free of any form
of cultural imposition.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>149. For a healthy relationship between love of one’s native land
and a sound sense of belonging to our larger human family, it is
helpful to keep in mind that global society is not the sum total of
different countries, but rather the communion that exists among them.
The mutual sense of belonging is prior to the emergence of individual
groups. Each particular group becomes part of the fabric of universal
communion and there discovers its own beauty. All individuals, whatever
their origin, know that they are part of the greater human family,
without which they will not be able to understand themselves fully. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>150. To see things in this way brings the joyful realization that no
one people, culture or individual can achieve everything on its own: to
attain fulfilment in life we need others. An awareness of our own
limitations and incompleteness, far from being a threat, becomes the
key to envisaging and pursuing a common project. For “man is a limited
being who is himself limitless”.<a name="_ftnref130" title="" href="#_ftn130">[130]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Starting_with_our_own_region_">Starting with our own region </a> </i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>151. Thanks to regional exchanges, by which poorer countries become
open to the wider world, universality does not necessarily water down
their distinct features. An appropriate and authentic openness to the
world presupposes the capacity to be open to one’s neighbour within a
family of nations. Cultural, economic and political integration with
neighbouring peoples should therefore be accompanied by a process of
education that promotes the value of love for one’s neighbour, the
first indispensable step towards attaining a healthy universal
integration. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>152. In some areas of our cities, there is still a lively sense of
neighbourhood. Each person quite spontaneously perceives a duty to
accompany and help his or her neighbour. In places where these
community values are maintained, people experience a closeness marked
by gratitude, solidarity and reciprocity. The neighbourhood gives them
a sense of shared identity.<a name="_ftnref131" title="" href="#_ftn131">[131]</a>
Would that neighbouring countries were able to encourage a similar
neighbourly spirit between their peoples! Yet the spirit of
individualism also affects relations between countries. The danger of
thinking that we have to protect ourselves from one another, of viewing
others as competitors or dangerous enemies, also affects relations
between peoples in the same region. Perhaps we were trained in this
kind of fear and mistrust. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>153. There are powerful countries and large businesses that profit
from this isolation and prefer to negotiate with each country
separately. On the other hand, small or poor countries can sign
agreements with their regional neighbours that will allow them to
negotiate as a bloc and thus avoid being cut off, isolated and
dependent on the great powers. Today, no state can ensure the common
good of its population if it remains isolated. <br clear="all"></big></font> </big></p><big>

that exploits them demagogically for its own purposes, or a liberalism
that serves the economic interests of the powerful. In both cases, it
becomes difficult to envisage an open world that makes room for
everyone, including the most vulnerable, and shows respect for

invaded the communications media and everyday conversation. As a
result, they have lost whatever value they might have had, and have
become another source of polarization in an already divided society.
Efforts are made to classify entire peoples, groups, societies and
governments as “populist” or not. Nowadays it has become impossible for
someone to express a view on any subject without being categorized one
way or the other, either to be unfairly discredited or to be praised to
the skies. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>157. The attempt to see populism as a key for interpreting social
reality is problematic in another way: it disregards the legitimate
meaning of the word “people”. Any effort to remove this concept from
common parlance could lead to the elimination of the very notion of
democracy as “government by the people”. If we wish to maintain that
society is more than a mere aggregate of individuals, the term “people”
proves necessary. There are social phenomena that create majorities, as
well as megatrends and communitarian aspirations. Men and women are
capable of coming up with shared goals that transcend their differences
and can thus engage in a common endeavour. Then too, it is extremely
difficult to carry out a long-term project unless it becomes a
collective aspiration. All these factors lie behind our use of the
words “people” and “popular”. Unless they are taken into account –
together with a sound critique of demagoguery – a fundamental aspect of
social reality would be overlooked.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>158. Here, there can be a misunderstanding. “‘People’ is not a
logical category, nor is it a mystical category, if by that we mean
that everything the people does is good, or that the people is an
‘angelic’ reality. Rather, it is a mythic category… When you have to
explain what you mean by people, you use logical categories for the
sake of explanation, and necessarily so. Yet in that way you cannot
explain what it means to belong to a people. The word ‘people’ has a
deeper meaning that cannot be set forth in purely logical terms. To be
part of a people is to be part of a shared identity arising from social
and cultural bonds. And that is not something automatic, but rather a
slow, difficult process… of advancing towards a common project”.<a name="_ftnref132" title="" href="#_ftn132">[132]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>159. “Popular” leaders, those capable of interpreting the feelings
and cultural dynamics of a people, and significant trends in society,
do exist. The service they provide by their efforts to unite and lead
can become the basis of an enduring vision of transformation and growth
that would also include making room for others in the pursuit of the
common good. But this can degenerate into an unhealthy “populism” when
individuals are able to exploit politically a people’s culture, under
whatever ideological banner, for their own personal advantage or
continuing grip on power. Or when, at other times, they seek popularity
by appealing to the basest and most selfish inclinations of certain
sectors of the population. This becomes all the more serious when,
whether in cruder or more subtle forms, it leads to the usurpation of
institutions and laws.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>160. Closed populist groups distort the word “people”, since they
are not talking about a true people. The concept of “people” is in fact
open-ended. A living and dynamic people, a people with a future, is one
constantly open to a new synthesis through its ability to welcome
differences. In this way, it does not deny its proper identity, but is
open to being mobilized, challenged, broadened and enriched by others,
and thus to further growth and development. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>161. Another sign of the decline of popular leadership is concern
for short-term advantage. One meets popular demands for the sake of
gaining votes or support, but without advancing in an arduous and
constant effort to generate the resources people need to develop and
earn a living by their own efforts and creativity. In this regard, I
have made it clear that “I have no intention of proposing an
irresponsible populism”.<a name="_ftnref133" title="" href="#_ftn133">[133]</a>
Eliminating inequality requires an economic growth that can help to tap
each region’s potential and thus guarantee a sustainable equality.<a name="_ftnref134" title="" href="#_ftn134">[134]</a>
At the same time, it follows that “welfare projects, which meet certain
urgent needs, should be considered merely temporary responses”.<a name="_ftnref135" title="" href="#_ftn135">[135]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>162. The biggest issue is employment. The truly “popular” thing –
since it promotes the good of the people – is to provide everyone with
the opportunity to nurture the seeds that God has planted in each of
us: our talents, our initiative and our innate resources. This is the
finest help we can give to the poor, the best path to a life of
dignity. Hence my insistence that, “helping the poor financially must
always be a provisional solution in the face of pressing needs. The
broader objective should always be to allow them a dignified life
through work”.<a name="_ftnref136" title="" href="#_ftn136">[136]</a>
Since production systems may change, political systems must keep
working to structure society in such a way that everyone has a chance
to contribute his or her own talents and efforts. For “there is no
poverty worse than that which takes away work and the dignity of work”.<a name="_ftnref137" title="" href="#_ftn137">[137]</a>
In a genuinely developed society, work is an essential dimension of
social life, for it is not only a means of earning one’s daily bread,
but also of personal growth, the building of healthy relationships,
self-expression and the exchange of gifts. Work gives us a sense of
shared responsibility for the development of the world, and ultimately,
for our life as a people.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="The_benefits_and_limits_of_liberal_approaches">The benefits and limits of liberal approaches</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>163. The concept of a “people”, which naturally entails a positive
view of community and cultural bonds, is usually rejected by
individualistic liberal approaches, which view society as merely the
sum of coexisting interests. One speaks of respect for freedom, but
without roots in a shared narrative; in certain contexts, those who
defend the rights of the most vulnerable members of society tend to be
criticized as populists. The notion of a people is considered an
abstract construct, something that does not really exist. But this is
to create a needless dichotomy. Neither the notion of “people” nor that
of “neighbour” can be considered purely abstract or romantic, in such a
way that social organization, science and civic institutions can be
rejected or treated with contempt.<a name="_ftnref138" title="" href="#_ftn138">[138]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>164. Charity, on the other hand, unites both dimensions – the
abstract and the institutional – since it calls for an effective
process of historical change that embraces everything: institutions,
law, technology, experience, professional expertise, scientific
analysis, administrative procedures, and so forth. For that matter,
“private life cannot exist unless it is protected by public order. A
domestic hearth has no real warmth unless it is safeguarded by law, by
a state of tranquillity founded on law, and enjoys a minimum of
wellbeing ensured by the division of labour, commercial exchange,
social justice and political citizenship”.<a name="_ftnref139" title="" href="#_ftn139">[139]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>165. True charity is capable of incorporating all these elements in
its concern for others. In the case of personal encounters, including
those involving a distant or forgotten brother or sister, it can do so
by employing all the resources that the institutions of an organized,
free and creative society are capable of generating. Even the Good
Samaritan, for example, needed to have a nearby inn that could provide
the help that he was personally unable to offer. Love of neighbour is
concrete and squanders none of the resources needed to bring about
historical change that can benefit the poor and disadvantaged. At
times, however, leftist ideologies or social doctrines linked to
individualistic ways of acting and ineffective procedures affect only a
few, while the majority of those left behind remain dependent on the
goodwill of others. This demonstrates the need for a greater spirit of
fraternity, but also a more efficient worldwide organization to help
resolve the problems plaguing the abandoned who are suffering and dying
in poor countries. It also shows that there is no one solution, no
single acceptable methodology, no economic recipe that can be applied
indiscriminately to all. Even the most rigorous scientific studies can
propose different courses of action. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>166. Everything, then, depends on our ability to see the need for a
change of heart, attitudes and lifestyles. Otherwise, political
propaganda, the media and the shapers of public opinion will continue
to promote an individualistic and uncritical culture subservient to
unregulated economic interests and societal institutions at the service
of those who already enjoy too much power. My criticism of the
technocratic paradigm involves more than simply thinking that if we
control its excesses everything will be fine. The bigger risk does not
come from specific objects, material realities or institutions, but
from the way that they are used. It has to do with human weakness, the
proclivity to selfishness that is part of what the Christian tradition
refers to as “concupiscence”: the human inclination to be concerned
only with myself, my group, my own petty interests. Concupiscence is
not a flaw limited to our own day. It has been present from the
beginning of humanity, and has simply changed and taken on different
forms down the ages, using whatever means each moment of history can
provide. Concupiscence, however, can be overcome with the help of God.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>167. Education and upbringing, concern for others, a well-integrated
view of life and spiritual growth: all these are essential for quality
human relationships and for enabling society itself to react against
injustices, aberrations and abuses of economic, technological,
political and media power. Some liberal approaches ignore this factor
of human weakness; they envisage a world that follows a determined
order and is capable by itself of ensuring a bright future and
providing solutions for every problem.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>168. The marketplace, by itself, cannot resolve every problem,
however much we are asked to believe this dogma of neoliberal faith.
Whatever the challenge, this impoverished and repetitive school of
thought always offers the same recipes. Neoliberalism simply reproduces
itself by resorting to the magic theories of “spillover” or “trickle” –
without using the name – as the only solution to societal problems.
There is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged “spillover”
does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of
violence threatening the fabric of society. It is imperative to have a
proactive economic policy directed at “promoting an economy that
favours productive diversity and business creativity”<a name="_ftnref140" title="" href="#_ftn140">[140]</a>
and makes it possible for jobs to be created and not cut. Financial
speculation fundamentally aimed at quick profit continues to wreak
havoc. Indeed, “without internal forms of solidarity and mutual trust,
the market cannot completely fulfil its proper economic function. And
today this trust has ceased to exist”.<a name="_ftnref141" title="" href="#_ftn141">[141]</a>
The story did not end the way it was meant to, and the dogmatic
formulae of prevailing economic theory proved not to be infallible. The
fragility of world systems in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated
that not everything can be resolved by market freedom. It has also
shown that, in addition to recovering a sound political life that is
not subject to the dictates of finance, “we must put human dignity back
at the centre and on that pillar build the alternative social
structures we need”.<a name="_ftnref142" title="" href="#_ftn142">[142]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>169. In some closed and monochrome economic approaches, for example,
there seems to be no place for popular movements that unite the
unemployed, temporary and informal workers and many others who do not
easily find a place in existing structures. Yet those movements manage
various forms of popular economy and of community production. What is
needed is a model of social, political and economic participation “that
can include popular movements and invigorate local, national and
international governing structures with that torrent of moral energy
that springs from including the excluded in the building of a common
destiny”, while also ensuring that “these experiences of solidarity
which grow up from below, from the subsoil of the planet – can come
together, be more coordinated, keep on meeting one another”.<a name="_ftnref143" title="" href="#_ftn143">[143]</a>
This, however, must happen in a way that will not betray their
distinctive way of acting as “sowers of change, promoters of a process
involving millions of actions, great and small, creatively intertwined
like words in a poem”.<a name="_ftnref144" title="" href="#_ftn144">[144]</a>
In that sense, such movements are “social poets” that, in their own
way, work, propose, promote and liberate. They help make possible an
integral human development that goes beyond “the idea of social
policies being a policy <i>for</i> the poor, but never <i>with</i> the poor and never <i>of</i> the poor, much less part of a project that reunites peoples”.<a name="_ftnref145" title="" href="#_ftn145">[145]</a>
They may be troublesome, and certain “theorists” may find it hard to
classify them, yet we must find the courage to acknowledge that,
without them, “democracy atrophies, turns into a mere word, a
formality; it loses its representative character and becomes
disembodied, since it leaves out the people in their daily struggle for
dignity, in the building of their future”.<a name="_ftnref146" title="" href="#_ftn146">[146]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="INTERNATIONAL_POWER">INTERNATIONAL POWER</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>170. I would once more observe that “the financial crisis of 2007-08
provided an opportunity to develop a new economy, more attentive to
ethical principles, and new ways of regulating speculative financial
practices and virtual wealth. But the response to the crisis did not
include rethinking the outdated criteria which continue to rule the
world”.<a name="_ftnref147" title="" href="#_ftn147">[147]</a> Indeed,
it appears that the actual strategies developed worldwide in the wake
of the crisis fostered greater individualism, less integration and
increased freedom for the truly powerful, who always find a way to
escape unscathed.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>171. I would also insist that “to give to each his own – to cite the
classic definition of justice – means that no human individual or group
can consider itself absolute, entitled to bypass the dignity and the
rights of other individuals or their social groupings. The effective
distribution of power (especially political, economic, defence-related
and technological power) among a plurality of subjects, and the
creation of a juridical system for regulating claims and interests, are
one concrete way of limiting power. Yet today’s world presents us with
many false rights and – at the same time – broad sectors which are
vulnerable, victims of power badly exercised”.<a name="_ftnref148" title="" href="#_ftn148">[148]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>172. The twenty-first century “is witnessing a weakening of the
power of nation states, chiefly because the economic and financial
sectors, being transnational, tend to prevail over the political. Given
this situation, it is essential to devise stronger and more efficiently
organized international institutions, with functionaries who are
appointed fairly by agreement among national governments, and empowered
to impose sanctions”.<a name="_ftnref149" title="" href="#_ftn149">[149]</a> When we talk about the possibility of some form of world authority regulated by law,<a name="_ftnref150" title="" href="#_ftn150">[150]</a>
we need not necessarily think of a personal authority. Still, such an
authority ought at least to promote more effective world organizations,
equipped with the power to provide for the global common good, the
elimination of hunger and poverty and the sure defence of fundamental
human rights.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>173. In this regard, I would also note the need for a reform of “the
United Nations Organization, and likewise of economic institutions and
international finance, so that the concept of the family of nations can
acquire real teeth”.<a name="_ftnref151" title="" href="#_ftn151">[151]</a>
Needless to say, this calls for clear legal limits to avoid power being
co-opted only by a few countries and to prevent cultural impositions or
a restriction of the basic freedoms of weaker nations on the basis of
ideological differences. For “the international community is a
juridical community founded on the sovereignty of each member state,
without bonds of subordination that deny or limit its independence”.<a name="_ftnref152" title="" href="#_ftn152">[152]</a>
At the same time, “the work of the United Nations, according to the
principles set forth in the Preamble and the first Articles of its
founding Charter, can be seen as the development and promotion of the
rule of law, based on the realization that justice is an essential
condition for achieving the ideal of universal fraternity… There is a
need to ensure the uncontested rule of law and tireless recourse to
negotiation, mediation and arbitration, as proposed by the Charter of
the United Nations, which constitutes truly a fundamental juridical
norm”.<a name="_ftnref153" title="" href="#_ftn153">[153]</a> There is
need to prevent this Organization from being delegitimized, since its
problems and shortcomings are capable of being jointly addressed and
resolved.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>174. Courage and generosity are needed in order freely to establish
shared goals and to ensure the worldwide observance of certain
essential norms. For this to be truly useful, it is essential to uphold
“the need to be faithful to agreements undertaken (<i>pacta sunt servanda</i>)”,<a name="_ftnref154" title="" href="#_ftn154">[154]</a> and to avoid the “temptation to appeal to the law of force rather than to the force of law”.<a name="_ftnref155" title="" href="#_ftn155">[155]</a>
This means reinforcing the “normative instruments for the peaceful
resolution of controversies... so as to strengthen their scope and
binding force”.<a name="_ftnref156" title="" href="#_ftn156">[156]</a>
Among these normative instruments, preference should be given to
multilateral agreements between states, because, more than bilateral
agreements, they guarantee the promotion of a truly universal common
good and the protection of weaker states.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>175. Providentially, many groups and organizations within civil
society help to compensate for the shortcomings of the international
community, its lack of coordination in complex situations, its lack of
attention to fundamental human rights and to the critical needs of
certain groups. Here we can see a concrete application of the principle
of subsidiarity, which justifies the participation and activity of
communities and organizations on lower levels as a means of integrating
and complementing the activity of the state. These groups and
organizations often carry out commendable efforts in the service of the
common good and their members at times show true heroism, revealing
something of the grandeur of which our humanity is still capable.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>176. For many people today, politics is a distasteful word, often
due to the mistakes, corruption and inefficiency of some politicians.
There are also attempts to discredit politics, to replace it with
economics or to twist it to one ideology or another. Yet can our world
function without politics? Can there be an effective process of growth
towards universal fraternity and social peace without a sound political
life?<a name="_ftnref157" title="" href="#_ftn157">[157]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="The_politics_we_need">The politics we need</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>177. Here I would once more observe that “politics must not be
subject to the economy, nor should the economy be subject to the
dictates of an efficiency-driven paradigm of technocracy”.<a name="_ftnref158" title="" href="#_ftn158">[158]</a>
Although misuse of power, corruption, disregard for law and
inefficiency must clearly be rejected, “economics without politics
cannot be justified, since this would make it impossible to favour
other ways of handling the various aspects of the present crisis”.<a name="_ftnref159" title="" href="#_ftn159">[159]</a>
Instead, “what is needed is a politics which is far-sighted and capable
of a new, integral and interdisciplinary approach to handling the
different aspects of the crisis”.<a name="_ftnref160" title="" href="#_ftn160">[160]</a>
In other words, a “healthy politics… capable of reforming and
coordinating institutions, promoting best practices and overcoming
undue pressure and bureaucratic inertia”.<a name="_ftnref161" title="" href="#_ftn161">[161]</a> We cannot expect economics to do this, nor can we allow economics to take over the real power of the state.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>178. In the face of many petty forms of politics focused on
immediate interests, I would repeat that “true statecraft is manifest
when, in difficult times, we uphold high principles and think of the
long-term common good. Political powers do not find it easy to assume
this duty in the work of nation-building”,<a name="_ftnref162" title="" href="#_ftn162">[162]</a>
much less in forging a common project for the human family, now and in
the future. Thinking of those who will come after us does not serve
electoral purposes, yet it is what authentic justice demands. As the
Bishops of Portugal have taught, the earth “is lent to each generation,
to be handed on to the generation that follows”.<a name="_ftnref163" title="" href="#_ftn163">[163]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>179. Global society is suffering from grave structural deficiencies
that cannot be resolved by piecemeal solutions or quick fixes. Much
needs to change, through fundamental reform and major renewal. Only a
healthy politics, involving the most diverse sectors and skills, is
capable of overseeing this process. An economy that is an integral part
of a political, social, cultural and popular programme directed to the
common good could pave the way for “different possibilities which do
not involve stifling human creativity and its ideals of progress, but
rather directing that energy along new channels”.<a name="_ftnref164" title="" href="#_ftn164">[164]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>180. Recognizing that all people are our brothers and sisters, and
seeking forms of social friendship that include everyone, is not merely
utopian. It demands a decisive commitment to devising effective means
to this end. Any effort along these lines becomes a noble exercise of
charity. For whereas individuals can help others in need, when they
join together in initiating social processes of fraternity and justice
for all, they enter the “field of charity at its most vast, namely
political charity”.<a name="_ftnref165" title="" href="#_ftn165">[165]</a> This entails working for a social and political order whose soul is social charity.<a name="_ftnref166" title="" href="#_ftn166">[166]</a>
Once more, I appeal for a renewed appreciation of politics as “a lofty
vocation and one of the highest forms of charity, inasmuch as it seeks
the common good”.<a name="_ftnref167" title="" href="#_ftn167">[167]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>181. Every commitment inspired by the Church’s social doctrine is
“derived from charity, which according to the teaching of Jesus is the
synthesis of the entire Law (cf. <i>Mt</i><a name="_ftnref168" title="" href="#_ftn168">[168]</a>
This means acknowledging that “love, overflowing with small gestures of
mutual care, is also civic and political, and it makes itself felt in
every action that seeks to build a better world”.<a name="_ftnref169" title="" href="#_ftn169">[169]</a>
For this reason, charity finds expression not only in close and
intimate relationships but also in “macro-relationships: social,
economic and political”.<a name="_ftnref170" title="" href="#_ftn170">[170]</a> 22:36-40)”.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>182. This political charity is born of a social awareness that
transcends every individualistic mindset: “‘Social charity makes us
love the common good’, it makes us effectively seek the good of all
people, considered not only as individuals or private persons, but also
in the social dimension that unites them”.<a name="_ftnref171" title="" href="#_ftn171">[171]</a>
Each of us is fully a person when we are part of a people; at the same
time, there are no peoples without respect for the individuality of
each person. “People” and “person” are correlative terms. Nonetheless,
there are attempts nowadays to reduce persons to isolated individuals
easily manipulated by powers pursuing spurious interests. Good politics
will seek ways of building communities at every level of social life,
in order to recalibrate and reorient globalization and thus avoid its
disruptive effects.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Effective_love_">Effective love</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>183. “Social love”<a name="_ftnref172" title="" href="#_ftn172">[172]</a>
makes it possible to advance towards a civilization of love, to which
all of us can feel called. Charity, with its impulse to universality,
is capable of building a new world.<a name="_ftnref173" title="" href="#_ftn173">[173]</a>
No mere sentiment, it is the best means of discovering effective paths
of development for everyone. Social love is a “force capable of
inspiring new ways of approaching the problems of today’s world, of
profoundly renewing structures, social organizations and legal systems
from within”.<a name="_ftnref174" title="" href="#_ftn174">[174]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>184. Charity is at the heart of every healthy and open society, yet
today “it is easily dismissed as irrelevant for interpreting and giving
direction to moral responsibility”.<a name="_ftnref175" title="" href="#_ftn175">[175]</a>
Charity, when accompanied by a commitment to the truth, is much more
than personal feeling, and consequently need not “fall prey to
contingent subjective emotions and opinions”.<a name="_ftnref176" title="" href="#_ftn176">[176]</a><a name="_ftnref177" title="" href="#_ftn177">[177]</a>
Otherwise, it would be “excluded from the plans and processes of
promoting human development of universal range, in dialogue between
knowledge and praxis”.<a name="_ftnref178" title="" href="#_ftn178">[178]</a>
Without truth, emotion lacks relational and social content. Charity’s
openness to truth thus protects it from “a fideism that deprives it of
its human and universal breadth”.<a name="_ftnref179" title="" href="#_ftn179">[179]</a>
Indeed its close relation to truth fosters its universality and
preserves it from being “confined to a narrow field devoid of
relationships”.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>185. Charity needs the light of the truth that we constantly seek.
“That light is both the light of reason and the light of faith”,<a name="_ftnref180" title="" href="#_ftn180">[180]</a>
and does not admit any form of relativism. Yet it also respects the
development of the sciences and their essential contribution to finding
the surest and most practical means of achieving the desired results.
For when the good of others is at stake, good intentions are not
enough. Concrete efforts must be made to bring about whatever they and
their nations need for the sake of their development.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>186. There is a kind of love that is “elicited”: its acts proceed
directly from the virtue of charity and are directed to individuals and
peoples. There is also a “commanded” love, expressed in those acts of
charity that spur people to create more sound institutions, more just
regulations, more supportive structures.<a name="_ftnref181" title="" href="#_ftn181">[181]</a>
It follows that “it is an equally indispensable act of love to strive
to organize and structure society so that one’s neighbour will not find
himself in poverty”.<a name="_ftnref182" title="" href="#_ftn182">[182]</a>
It is an act of charity to assist someone suffering, but it is also an
act of charity, even if we do not know that person, to work to change
the social conditions that caused his or her suffering. If someone
helps an elderly person cross a river, that is a fine act of charity.
The politician, on the other hand, builds a bridge, and that too is an
act of charity. While one person can help another by providing
something to eat, the politician creates a job for that other person,
and thus practices a lofty form of charity that ennobles his or her
political activity.</big></font></big></p><big>

always a preferential love shown to those in greatest need; it
undergirds everything we do on their behalf.<a name="_ftnref183" title="" href="#_ftn183">[183]</a>
Only a gaze transformed by charity can enable the dignity of others to
be recognized and, as a consequence, the poor to be acknowledged and
valued in their dignity, respected in their identity and culture, and
thus truly integrated into society. That gaze is at the heart of the
authentic spirit of politics. It sees paths open up that are different
from those of a soulless pragmatism. It makes us realize that “the
scandal of poverty cannot be addressed by promoting strategies of
containment that only tranquilize the poor and render them tame and
inoffensive. How sad it is when we find, behind allegedly altruistic
works, the other being reduced to passivity”.<a name="_ftnref184" title="" href="#_ftn184">[184]</a>
What are needed are new pathways of self-expression and participation
in society. Education serves these by making it possible for each human
being to shape his or her own future. Here too we see the importance of
the principle of <i>subsidiarity</i>, which is inseparable from the principle of <i>solidarity</i>.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>188. These considerations help us recognize the urgent need to
combat all that threatens or violates fundamental human rights.
Politicians are called to “tend to the needs of individuals and
peoples. To tend those in need takes strength and tenderness, effort
and generosity in the midst of a functionalistic and privatized mindset
that inexorably leads to a ‘throwaway culture’… It involves taking
responsibility for the present with its situations of utter
marginalization and anguish, and being capable of bestowing dignity
upon it”.<a name="_ftnref185" title="" href="#_ftn185">[185]</a> It
will likewise inspire intense efforts to ensure that “everything be
done to protect the status and dignity of the human person”.<a name="_ftnref186" title="" href="#_ftn186">[186]</a>
Politicians are doers, builders with ambitious goals, possessed of a
broad, realistic and pragmatic gaze that looks beyond their own
borders. Their biggest concern should not be about a drop in the polls,
but about finding effective solutions to “the phenomenon of social and
economic exclusion, with its baneful consequences: human trafficking,
the marketing of human organs and tissues, the sexual exploitation of
boys and girls, slave labour, including prostitution, the drug and
weapons trade, terrorism and international organized crime. Such is the
magnitude of these situations, and their toll in innocent lives, that
we must avoid every temptation to fall into a declarationist nominalism
that would assuage our consciences. We need to ensure that our
institutions are truly effective in the struggle against all these
scourges”.<a name="_ftnref187" title="" href="#_ftn187">[187]</a> This includes taking intelligent advantage of the immense resources offered by technological development.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>189. We are still far from a globalization of the most basic of
human rights. That is why world politics needs to make the effective
elimination of hunger one of its foremost and imperative goals. Indeed,
“when financial speculation manipulates the price of food, treating it
as just another commodity, millions of people suffer and die from
hunger. At the same time, tons of food are thrown away. This
constitutes a genuine scandal. Hunger is criminal; food is an
inalienable right”.<a name="_ftnref188" title="" href="#_ftn188">[188]</a>
Often, as we carry on our semantic or ideological disputes, we allow
our brothers and sisters to die of hunger and thirst, without shelter
or access to health care. Alongside these basic needs that remain
unmet, trafficking in persons represents another source of shame for
humanity, one that international politics, moving beyond fine speeches
and good intentions, must no longer tolerate. These things are
essential; they can no longer be deferred.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>190. Political charity is also expressed in a spirit of openness to
everyone. Government leaders should be the first to make the sacrifices
that foster encounter and to seek convergence on at least some issues.
They should be ready to listen to other points of view and to make room
for everyone. Through sacrifice and patience, they can help to create a
beautiful polyhedral reality in which everyone has a place. Here,
economic negotiations do not work. Something else is required: an
exchange of gifts for the common good. It may seem naïve and utopian,
yet we cannot renounce this lofty aim.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>191. At a time when various forms of fundamentalist intolerance are
damaging relationships between individuals, groups and peoples, let us
be committed to living and teaching the value of respect for others, a
love capable of welcoming differences, and the priority of the dignity
of every human being over his or her ideas, opinions, practices and
even sins. Even as forms of fanaticism, closedmindedness and social and
cultural fragmentation proliferate in present-day society, a good
politician will take the first step and insist that different voices be
heard. Disagreements may well give rise to conflicts, but uniformity
proves stifling and leads to cultural decay. May we not be content with
being enclosed in one fragment of reality.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>192. In this regard, Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb and I have called
upon “the architects of international policy and world economy to work
strenuously to spread the culture of tolerance and of living together
in peace; to intervene at the earliest opportunity to stop the shedding
of innocent blood”.<a name="_ftnref189" title="" href="#_ftn189">[189]</a>
When a specific policy sows hatred and fear towards other nations in
the name of its own country’s welfare, there is need to be concerned,
to react in time and immediately to correct the course.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>193. Apart from their tireless activity, politicians are also men
and women. They are called to practice love in their daily
interpersonal relationships. As persons, they need to consider that
“the modern world, with its technical advances, tends increasingly to
functionalize the satisfaction of human desires, now classified and
subdivided among different services. Less and less will people be
called by name, less and less will this unique being be treated as a
person with his or her own feelings, sufferings, problems, joys and
family. Their illnesses will be known only in order to cure them, their
financial needs only to provide for them, their lack of a home only to
give them lodging, their desires for recreation and entertainment only
to satisfy them”. Yet it must never be forgotten that “loving the most
insignificant of human beings as a brother, as if there were no one
else in the world but him, cannot be considered a waste of time”.<a name="_ftnref190" title="" href="#_ftn190">[190]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>194. Politics too must make room for a tender love of others. “What
is tenderness? It is love that draws near and becomes real. A movement
that starts from our heart and reaches the eyes, the ears and the
hands… Tenderness is the path of choice for the strongest, most
courageous men and women”.<a name="_ftnref191" title="" href="#_ftn191">[191]</a>
Amid the daily concerns of political life, “the smallest, the weakest,
the poorest should touch our hearts: indeed, they have a ‘right’ to
appeal to our heart and soul. They are our brothers and sisters, and as
such we must love and care for them”.<a name="_ftnref192" title="" href="#_ftn192">[192]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>195. All this can help us realize that what is important is not
constantly achieving great results, since these are not always
possible. In political activity, we should remember that, “appearances
notwithstanding, every person is immensely holy and deserves our love.
Consequently, if I can help at least one person to have a better life,
that already justifies the offering of my life. It is a wonderful thing
to be God’s faithful people. We achieve fulfilment when we break down
walls and our hearts are filled with faces and names!”<a name="_ftnref193" title="" href="#_ftn193">[193]</a>
The great goals of our dreams and plans may only be achieved in part.
Yet beyond this, those who love, and who no longer view politics merely
as a quest for power, “may be sure that none of our acts of love will
be lost, nor any of our acts of sincere concern for others. No single
act of love for God will be lost, no generous effort is meaningless, no
painful endurance is wasted. All of these encircle our world like a
vital force”.<a name="_ftnref194" title="" href="#_ftn194">[194]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>196. For this reason, it is truly noble to place our hope in the
hidden power of the seeds of goodness we sow, and thus to initiate
processes whose fruits will be reaped by others. Good politics combines
love with hope and with confidence in the reserves of goodness present
in human hearts. Indeed, “authentic political life, built upon respect
for law and frank dialogue between individuals, is constantly renewed
whenever there is a realization that every woman and man, and every new
generation, brings the promise of new relational, intellectual,
cultural and spiritual energies”.<a name="_ftnref195" title="" href="#_ftn195">[195]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>197. Viewed in this way, politics is something more noble than
posturing, marketing and media spin. These sow nothing but division,
conflict and a bleak cynicism incapable of mobilizing people to pursue
a common goal. At times, in thinking of the future, we do well to ask
ourselves, “Why I am doing this?”, “What is my real aim?” For as time
goes on, reflecting on the past, the questions will not be: “How many
people endorsed me?”, “How many voted for me?”, “How many had a
positive image of me?” The real, and potentially painful, questions
will be, “How much love did I put into my work?” “What did I do for the
progress of our people?” “What mark did I leave on the life of
society?” “What real bonds did I create?” “What positive forces did I
unleash?” “How much social peace did I sow?” “What good did I achieve
in the position that was entrusted to me?”</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>198. Approaching, speaking, listening, looking at, coming to know
and understand one another, and to find common ground: all these things
are summed up in the one word “dialogue”. If we want to encounter and
help one another, we have to dialogue. There is no need for me to
stress the benefits of dialogue. I have only to think of what our world
would be like without the patient dialogue of the many generous persons
who keep families and communities together. Unlike disagreement and
conflict, persistent and courageous dialogue does not make headlines,
but quietly helps the world to live much better than we imagine.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="SOCIAL_DIALOGUE_FOR_A_NEW_CULTURE">SOCIAL DIALOGUE FOR A NEW CULTURE</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>199. Some people attempt to flee from reality, taking refuge in
their own little world; others react to it with destructive violence.
Yet “between selfish indifference and violent protest there is always
another possible option: that of dialogue. Dialogue between
generations; dialogue among our people, for we are that people;
readiness to give and receive, while remaining open to the truth. A
country flourishes when constructive dialogue occurs between its many
rich cultural components: popular culture, university culture, youth
culture, artistic culture, technological culture, economic culture,
family culture and media culture”.<a name="_ftnref196" title="" href="#_ftn196">[196]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>200. Dialogue is often confused with something quite different: the
feverish exchange of opinions on social networks, frequently based on
media information that is not always reliable. These exchanges are
merely parallel monologues. They may attract some attention by their
sharp and aggressive tone. But monologues engage no one, and their
content is frequently self-serving and contradictory.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>201. Indeed, the media’s noisy potpourri of facts and opinions is
often an obstacle to dialogue, since it lets everyone cling stubbornly
to his or her own ideas, interests and choices, with the excuse that
everyone else is wrong. It becomes easier to discredit and insult
opponents from the outset than to open a respectful dialogue aimed at
achieving agreement on a deeper level. Worse, this kind of language,
usually drawn from media coverage of political campaigns, has become so
widespread as to be part of daily conversation. Discussion is often
manipulated by powerful special interests that seek to tilt public
opinion unfairly in their favour. This kind of manipulation can be
exercised not only by governments, but also in economics, politics,
communications, religion and in other spheres. Attempts can be made to
justify or excuse it when it tends to serve one’s own economic or
ideological interests, but sooner or later it turns against those very
interests.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>202. Lack of dialogue means that in these individual sectors people
are concerned not for the common good, but for the benefits of power
or, at best, for ways to impose their own ideas. Round tables thus
become mere negotiating sessions, in which individuals attempt to seize
every possible advantage, rather than cooperating in the pursuit of the
common good. The heroes of the future will be those who can break with
this unhealthy mindset and determine respectfully to promote
truthfulness, aside from personal interest. God willing, such heroes
are quietly emerging, even now, in the midst of our society.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Building_together">Building together</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>203. Authentic social dialogue involves the ability to respect the
other’s point of view and to admit that it may include legitimate
convictions and concerns. Based on their identity and experience,
others have a contribution to make, and it is desirable that they
should articulate their positions for the sake of a more fruitful
public debate. When individuals or groups are consistent in their
thinking, defend their values and convictions, and develop their
arguments, this surely benefits society. Yet, this can only occur to
the extent that there is genuine dialogue and openness to others.
Indeed, “in a true spirit of dialogue, we grow in our ability to grasp
the significance of what others say and do, even if we cannot accept it
as our own conviction. In this way, it becomes possible to be frank and
open about our beliefs, while continuing to discuss, to seek points of
contact, and above all, to work and struggle together”.<a name="_ftnref197" title="" href="#_ftn197">[197]</a>
Public discussion, if it truly makes room for everyone and does not
manipulate or conceal information, is a constant stimulus to a better
grasp of the truth, or at least its more effective expression. It keeps
different sectors from becoming complacent and self-centred in their
outlook and their limited concerns. Let us not forget that “differences
are creative; they create tension and in the resolution of tension lies
humanity’s progress”.<a name="_ftnref198" title="" href="#_ftn198">[198]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>204. There is a growing conviction that, together with specialized
scientific advances, we are in need of greater interdisciplinary
communication. Although reality is one, it can be approached from
various angles and with different methodologies. There is a risk that a
single scientific advance will be seen as the only possible lens for
viewing a particular aspect of life, society and the world. Researchers
who are expert in their own field, yet also familiar with the findings
of other sciences and disciplines, are in a position to discern other
aspects of the object of their study and thus to become open to a more
comprehensive and integral knowledge of reality.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>205. In today’s globalized world, “the media can help us to feel
closer to one another, creating a sense of the unity of the human
family which in turn can inspire solidarity and serious efforts to
ensure a more dignified life for all… The media can help us greatly in
this, especially nowadays, when the networks of human communication
have made unprecedented advances. The internet, in particular, offers
immense possibilities for encounter and solidarity. This is something
truly good, a gift from God”.<a name="_ftnref199" title="" href="#_ftn199">[199]</a>
We need constantly to ensure that present-day forms of communication
are in fact guiding us to generous encounter with others, to honest
pursuit of the whole truth, to service, to closeness to the
underprivileged and to the promotion of the common good. As the Bishops
of Australia have pointed out, we cannot accept “a digital world
designed to exploit our weaknesses and bring out the worst in people”.<a name="_ftnref200" title="" href="#_ftn200">[200]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>206. The solution is not relativism. Under the guise of tolerance,
relativism ultimately leaves the interpretation of moral values to
those in power, to be defined as they see fit. “In the absence of
objective truths or sound principles other than the satisfaction of our
own desires and immediate needs… we should not think that political
efforts or the force of law will be sufficient… When the culture itself
is corrupt, and objective truth and universally valid principles are no
longer upheld, then laws can only be seen as arbitrary impositions or
obstacles to be avoided”.<a name="_ftnref201" title="" href="#_ftn201">[201]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>207. Is it possible to be concerned for truth, to seek the truth
that responds to life’s deepest meaning? What is law without the
conviction, born of age-old reflection and great wisdom, that each
human being is sacred and inviolable? If society is to have a future,
it must respect the truth of our human dignity and submit to that
truth. Murder is not wrong simply because it is socially unacceptable
and punished by law, but because of a deeper conviction. This is a
non-negotiable truth attained by the use of reason and accepted in
conscience. A society is noble and decent not least for its support of
the pursuit of truth and its adherence to the most basic of truths.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>208. We need to learn how to unmask the various ways that the truth
is manipulated, distorted and concealed in public and private
discourse. What we call “truth” is not only the reporting of facts and
events, such as we find in the daily papers. It is primarily the search
for the solid foundations sustaining our decisions and our laws. This
calls for acknowledging that the human mind is capable of transcending
immediate concerns and grasping certain truths that are unchanging, as
true now as in the past. As it peers into human nature, reason
discovers universal values derived from that same nature.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>209. Otherwise, is it not conceivable that those fundamental human
rights which we now consider unassailable will be denied by those in
power, once they have gained the “consensus” of an apathetic or
intimidated population? Nor would a mere consensus between different
nations, itself equally open to manipulation, suffice to protect them.
We have ample evidence of the great good of which we are capable, yet
we also have to acknowledge our inherent destructiveness. Is not the
indifference and the heartless individualism into which we have fallen
also a result of our sloth in pursuing higher values, values that
transcend our immediate needs? Relativism always brings the risk that
some or other alleged truth will be imposed by the powerful or the
clever. Yet, “when it is a matter of the moral norms prohibiting
intrinsic evil, there are no privileges or exceptions for anyone. It
makes no difference whether one is the master of the world or the
‘poorest of the poor’ on the face of the earth. Before the demands of
morality we are all absolutely equal”.<a name="_ftnref202" title="" href="#_ftn202">[202]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>210. What is now happening, and drawing us into a perverse and
barren way of thinking, is the reduction of ethics and politics to
physics. Good and evil no longer exist in themselves; there is only a
calculus of benefits and burdens. As a result of the displacement of
moral reasoning, the law is no longer seen as reflecting a fundamental
notion of justice but as mirroring notions currently in vogue.
Breakdown ensues: everything is “leveled down” by a superficial
bartered consensus. In the end, the law of the strongest prevails.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Consensus_and_truth_">Consensus and truth</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>211. In a pluralistic society, dialogue is the best way to realize
what ought always to be affirmed and respected apart from any ephemeral
consensus. Such dialogue needs to be enriched and illumined by clear
thinking, rational arguments, a variety of perspectives and the
contribution of different fields of knowledge and points of view. Nor
can it exclude the conviction that it is possible to arrive at certain
fundamental truths always to be upheld. Acknowledging the existence of
certain enduring values, however demanding it may be to discern them,
makes for a robust and solid social ethics. Once those fundamental
values are acknowledged and adopted through dialogue and consensus, we
realize that they rise above consensus; they transcend our concrete
situations and remain non-negotiable. Our understanding of their
meaning and scope can increase – and in that respect, consensus is a
dynamic reality – but in themselves, they are held to be enduring by
virtue of their inherent meaning.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>212. If something always serves the good functioning of society, is
it not because, lying beyond it, there is an enduring truth accessible
to the intellect? Inherent in the nature of human beings and society
there exist certain basic structures to support our development and
survival. Certain requirements thus ensue, and these can be discovered
through dialogue, even though, strictly speaking, they are not created
by consensus. The fact that certain rules are indispensable for the
very life of society is a sign that they are good in and of themselves.
There is no need, then, to oppose the interests of society, consensus
and the reality of objective truth. These three realities can be
harmonized whenever, through dialogue, people are unafraid to get to
the heart of an issue.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>213. The dignity of others is to be respected in all circumstances,
not because that dignity is something we have invented or imagined, but
because human beings possess an intrinsic worth superior to that of
material objects and contingent situations. This requires that they be
treated differently. That every human being possesses an inalienable
dignity is a truth that corresponds to human nature apart from all
cultural change. For this reason, human beings have the same inviolable
dignity in every age of history and no one can consider himself or
herself authorized by particular situations to deny this conviction or
to act against it. The intellect can investigate the reality of things
through reflection, experience and dialogue, and come to recognize in
that reality, which transcends it, the basis of certain universal moral
demands.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>214. To agnostics, this foundation could prove sufficient to confer
a solid and stable universal validity on basic and non-negotiable
ethical principles that could serve to prevent further catastrophes. As
believers, we are convinced that human nature, as the source of ethical
principles, was created by God, and that ultimately it is he who gives
those principles their solid foundation.<a name="_ftnref203" title="" href="#_ftn203">[203]</a>
This does not result in an ethical rigidity nor does it lead to the
imposition of any one moral system, since fundamental and universally
valid moral principles can be embodied in different practical rules.
Thus, room for dialogue will always exist.</big></font></big></p><big>

I have frequently called for the growth of a culture of encounter
capable of transcending our differences and divisions. This means
working to create a many-faceted polyhedron whose different sides form
a variegated unity, in which “the whole is greater than the part”.<a name="_ftnref205" title="" href="#_ftn205">[205]</a>
The image of a polyhedron can represent a society where differences
coexist, complementing, enriching and reciprocally illuminating one
another, even amid disagreements and reservations. Each of us can learn
something from others. No one is useless and no one is expendable. This
also means finding ways to include those on the peripheries of life.
For they have another way of looking at things; they see aspects of
reality that are invisible to the centres of power where weighty
decisions are made.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Encounter_that_becomes_culture">Encounter that becomes culture</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>216. The word “culture” points to something deeply embedded within a
people, its most cherished convictions and its way of life. A people’s
“culture” is more than an abstract idea. It has to do with their
desires, their interests and ultimately the way they live their lives.
To speak of a “culture of encounter” means that we, as a people, should
be passionate about meeting others, seeking points of contact, building
bridges, planning a project that includes everyone. This becomes an
aspiration and a style of life. The subject of this culture is the
people, not simply one part of society that would pacify the rest with
the help of professional and media resources.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>217. Social peace demands hard work, craftsmanship. It would be
easier to keep freedoms and differences in check with cleverness and a
few resources. But such a peace would be superficial and fragile, not
the fruit of a culture of encounter that brings enduring stability.
Integrating differences is a much more difficult and slow process, yet
it is the guarantee of a genuine and lasting peace. That peace is not
achieved by recourse only to those who are pure and untainted, since
“even people who can be considered questionable on account of their
errors have something to offer which must not be overlooked”.<a name="_ftnref206" title="" href="#_ftn206">[206]</a>
Nor does it come from ignoring social demands or quelling disturbances,
since it is not “a consensus on paper or a transient peace for a
contented minority”.<a name="_ftnref207" title="" href="#_ftn207">[207]</a> What is important is to create <i>processes</i>
of encounter, processes that build a people that can accept
differences. Let us arm our children with the weapons of dialogue! Let
us teach them to fight the good fight of the culture of encounter!</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>218. All this calls for the ability to recognize other people’s
right to be themselves and to be different. This recognition, as it
becomes a culture, makes possible the creation of a social covenant.
Without it, subtle ways can be found to make others insignificant,
irrelevant, of no value to society. While rejecting certain visible
forms of violence, another more insidious kind of violence can take
root: the violence of those who despise people who are different,
especially when their demands in any way compromise their own
particular interests.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>219. When one part of society exploits all that the world has to
offer, acting as if the poor did not exist, there will eventually be
consequences. Sooner or later, ignoring the existence and rights of
others will erupt in some form of violence, often when least expected.
Liberty, equality and fraternity can remain lofty ideals unless they
apply to everyone. Encounter cannot take place only between the holders
of economic, political or academic power. Genuine social encounter
calls for a dialogue that engages the culture shared by the majority of
the population. It often happens that good ideas are not accepted by
the poorer sectors of society because they are presented in a cultural
garb that is not their own and with which they cannot identify. A
realistic and inclusive social covenant must also be a “cultural
covenant”, one that respects and acknowledges the different worldviews,
cultures and lifestyles that coexist in society.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>220. Indigenous peoples, for example, are not opposed to progress,
yet theirs is a different notion of progress, often more humanistic
than the modern culture of developed peoples. Theirs is not a culture
meant to benefit the powerful, those driven to create for themselves a
kind of earthly paradise. Intolerance and lack of respect for
indigenous popular cultures is a form of violence grounded in a cold
and judgmental way of viewing them. No authentic, profound and enduring
change is possible unless it starts from the different cultures,
particularly those of the poor. A cultural covenant eschews a
monolithic understanding of the identity of a particular place; it
entails respect for diversity by offering opportunities for advancement
and social integration to all.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>221. Such a covenant also demands the realization that some things
may have to be renounced for the common good. No one can possess the
whole truth or satisfy his or her every desire, since that pretension
would lead to nullifying others by denying their rights. A false notion
of tolerance has to give way to a dialogic realism on the part of men
and women who remain faithful to their own principles while recognizing
that others also have the right to do likewise. This is the genuine
acknowledgment of the other that is made possible by love alone. We
have to stand in the place of others, if we are to discover what is
genuine, or at least understandable, in their motivations and concerns.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>222. Consumerist individualism has led to great injustice. Other
persons come to be viewed simply as obstacles to our own serene
existence; we end up treating them as annoyances and we become
increasingly aggressive. This is even more the case in times of crisis,
catastrophe and hardship, when we are tempted to think in terms of the
old saying, “every man for himself”. Yet even then, we can choose to
cultivate kindness. Those who do so become stars shining in the midst
of darkness.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>223. Saint Paul describes kindness as a fruit of the Holy Spirit (<i>Gal </i> 5:22). He uses the Greek word <i>chrestótes</i>,
which describes an attitude that is gentle, pleasant and supportive,
not rude or coarse. Individuals who possess this quality help make
other people’s lives more bearable, especially by sharing the weight of
their problems, needs and fears. This way of treating others can take
different forms: an act of kindness, a concern not to offend by word or
deed, a readiness to alleviate their burdens. It involves “speaking
words of comfort, strength, consolation and encouragement” and not
“words that demean, sadden, anger or show scorn”.<a name="_ftnref208" title="" href="#_ftn208">[208]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>224. Kindness frees us from the cruelty that at times infects human
relationships, from the anxiety that prevents us from thinking of
others, from the frantic flurry of activity that forgets that others
also have a right to be happy. Often nowadays we find neither the time
nor the energy to stop and be kind to others, to say “excuse me”,
“pardon me”, “thank you”. Yet every now and then, miraculously, a kind
person appears and is willing to set everything else aside in order to
show interest, to give the gift of a smile, to speak a word of
encouragement, to listen amid general indifference. If we make a daily
effort to do exactly this, we can create a healthy social atmosphere in
which misunderstandings can be overcome and conflict forestalled.
Kindness ought to be cultivated; it is no superficial bourgeois virtue.
Precisely because it entails esteem and respect for others, once
kindness becomes a culture within society it transforms lifestyles,
relationships and the ways ideas are discussed and compared. Kindness
facilitates the quest for consensus; it opens new paths where hostility
and conflict would burn all bridges.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>225. In many parts of the world, there is a need for paths of peace
to heal open wounds. There is also a need for peacemakers, men and
women prepared to work boldly and creatively to initiate processes of
healing and renewed encounter.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>226. Renewed encounter does not mean returning to a time prior to
conflicts. All of us change over time. Pain and conflict transform us.
We no longer have use for empty diplomacy, dissimulation, double-speak,
hidden agendas and good manners that mask reality. Those who were
fierce enemies have to speak from the stark and clear truth. They have
to learn how to cultivate a penitential memory, one that can accept the
past in order not to cloud the future with their own regrets, problems
and plans. Only by basing themselves on the historical truth of events
will they be able to make a broad and persevering effort to understand
one another and to strive for a new synthesis for the good of all.
Every “peace process requires enduring commitment. It is a patient
effort to seek truth and justice, to honour the memory of victims and
to open the way, step by step, to a shared hope stronger than the
desire for vengeance”.<a name="_ftnref209" title="" href="#_ftn209">[209]</a>
As the Bishops of the Congo have said with regard to one recurring
conflict: “Peace agreements on paper will not be enough. We will have
to go further, by respecting the demands of truth regarding the origins
of this recurring crisis. The people have the right to know what
happened”.<a name="_ftnref210" title="" href="#_ftn210">[210]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>227. “Truth, in fact, is an inseparable companion of justice and
mercy. All three together are essential to building peace; each,
moreover, prevents the other from being altered… Truth should not lead
to revenge, but rather to reconciliation and forgiveness. Truth means
telling families torn apart by pain what happened to their missing
relatives. Truth means confessing what happened to minors recruited by
cruel and violent people. Truth means recognizing the pain of women who
are victims of violence and abuse… Every act of violence committed
against a human being is a wound in humanity’s flesh; every violent
death diminishes us as people… Violence leads to more violence, hatred
to more hatred, death to more death. We must break this cycle which
seems inescapable”.<a name="_ftnref211" title="" href="#_ftn211">[211]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>228. The path to peace does not mean making society blandly uniform,
but getting people to work together, side-by-side, in pursuing goals
that benefit everyone. A wide variety of practical proposals and
diverse experiences can help achieve shared objectives and serve the
common good. The problems that a society is experiencing need to be
clearly identified, so that the existence of different ways of
understanding and resolving them can be appreciated. The path to social
unity always entails acknowledging the possibility that others have, at
least in part, a legitimate point of view, something worthwhile to
contribute, even if they were in error or acted badly. “We should never
confine others to what they may have said or done, but value them for
the promise that they embody”,<a name="_ftnref212" title="" href="#_ftn212">[212]</a> a promise that always brings with it a spark of new hope.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>229. The Bishops of South Africa have pointed out that true
reconciliation is achieved proactively, “by forming a new society, a
society based on service to others, rather than the desire to dominate;
a society based on sharing what one has with others, rather than the
selfish scramble by each for as much wealth as possible; a society in
which the value of being together as human beings is ultimately more
important than any lesser group, whether it be family, nation, race or
culture”.<a name="_ftnref213" title="" href="#_ftn213">[213]</a> As the
Bishops of South Korea have pointed out, true peace “can be achieved
only when we strive for justice through dialogue, pursuing
reconciliation and mutual development”.<a name="_ftnref214" title="" href="#_ftn214">[214]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>230. Working to overcome our divisions without losing our identity
as individuals presumes that a basic sense of belonging is present in
everyone. Indeed, “society benefits when each person and social group
feels truly at home. In a family, parents, grandparents and children
all feel at home; no one is excluded. If someone has a problem, even a
serious one, even if he brought it upon himself, the rest of the family
comes to his assistance; they support him. His problems are theirs… In
families, everyone contributes to the common purpose; everyone works
for the common good, not denying each person’s individuality but
encouraging and supporting it. They may quarrel, but there is something
that does not change: the family bond. Family disputes are always
resolved afterwards. The joys and sorrows of each of its members are
felt by all. That is what it means to be a family! If only we could
view our political opponents or neighbours in the same way that we view
our children or our spouse, mother or father! How good would this be!
Do we love our society or is it still something remote, something
anonymous that does not involve us, something to which we are not
committed?”<a name="_ftnref215" title="" href="#_ftn215">[215]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>231. Negotiation often becomes necessary for shaping concrete paths
to peace. Yet the processes of change that lead to lasting peace are
crafted above all by peoples; each individual can act as an effective
leaven by the way he or she lives each day. Great changes are not
produced behind desks or in offices. This means that “everyone has a
fundamental role to play in a single great creative project: to write a
new page of history, a page full of hope, peace and reconciliation”.<a name="_ftnref216" title="" href="#_ftn216">[216]</a>
There is an “architecture” of peace, to which different institutions of
society contribute, each according to its own area of expertise, but
there is also an “art” of peace that involves us all. From the various
peace processes that have taken place in different parts of the world,
“we have learned that these ways of making peace, of placing reason
above revenge, of the delicate harmony between politics and law, cannot
ignore the involvement of ordinary people. Peace is not achieved by
normative frameworks and institutional arrangements between
well-meaning political or economic groups… It is always helpful to
incorporate into our peace processes the experience of those sectors
that have often been overlooked, so that communities themselves can
influence the development of a collective memory”.<a name="_ftnref217" title="" href="#_ftn217">[217]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>232. There is no end to the building of a country’s social peace;
rather, it is “an open-ended endeavour, a never-ending task that
demands the commitment of everyone and challenges us to work tirelessly
to build the unity of the nation. Despite obstacles, differences and
varying perspectives on the way to achieve peaceful coexistence, this
task summons us to persevere in the struggle to promote a ‘culture of
encounter’. This requires us to place at the centre of all political,
social and economic activity the human person, who enjoys the highest
dignity, and respect for the common good. May this determination help
us flee from the temptation for revenge and the satisfaction of
short-term partisan interests”.<a name="_ftnref218" title="" href="#_ftn218">[218]</a>
Violent public demonstrations, on one side or the other, do not help in
finding solutions. Mainly because, as the Bishops of Colombia have
rightly noted, the “origins and objectives of civil demonstrations are
not always clear; certain forms of political manipulation are present
and in some cases they have been exploited for partisan interests”.<a name="_ftnref219" title="" href="#_ftn219">[219]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>233. Building social friendship does not only call for rapprochement
between groups who took different sides at some troubled period of
history, but also for a renewed encounter with the most impoverished
and vulnerable sectors of society. For peace “is not merely absence of
war but a tireless commitment – especially on the part of those of us
charged with greater responsibility – to recognize, protect and
concretely restore the dignity, so often overlooked or ignored, of our
brothers and sisters, so that they can see themselves as the principal
protagonists of the destiny of their nation”.<a name="_ftnref220" title="" href="#_ftn220">[220]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>234. Often, the more vulnerable members of society are the victims
of unfair generalizations. If at times the poor and the dispossessed
react with attitudes that appear antisocial, we should realize that in
many cases those reactions are born of a history of scorn and social
exclusion. The Latin American Bishops have observed that “only the
closeness that makes us friends can enable us to appreciate deeply the
values of the poor today, their legitimate desires, and their own
manner of living the faith. The option for the poor should lead us to
friendship with the poor”.<a name="_ftnref221" title="" href="#_ftn221">[221]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>235. Those who work for tranquil social coexistence should never
forget that inequality and lack of integral human development make
peace impossible. Indeed, “without equal opportunities, different forms
of aggression and conflict will find a fertile terrain for growth and
eventually explode. When a society – whether local, national or global
– is willing to leave a part of itself on the fringes, no political
programmes or resources spent on law enforcement or surveillance
systems can indefinitely guarantee tranquility”.<a name="_ftnref222" title="" href="#_ftn222">[222]</a> If we have to begin anew, it must always be from the least of our brothers and sisters.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>236. There are those who prefer not to talk of reconciliation, for
they think that conflict, violence and breakdown are part of the normal
functioning of a society. In any human group there are always going to
be more or less subtle power struggles between different parties.
Others think that promoting forgiveness means yielding ground and
influence to others. For this reason, they feel it is better to keep
things as they are, maintaining a balance of power between differing
groups. Still others believe that reconciliation is a sign of weakness;
incapable of truly serious dialogue, they choose to avoid problems by
ignoring injustices. Unable to deal with problems, they opt for an
apparent peace.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>237. Forgiveness and reconciliation are central themes in
Christianity and, in various ways, in other religions. Yet there is a
risk that an inadequate understanding and presentation of these
profound convictions can lead to fatalism, apathy and injustice, or
even intolerance and violence.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>238. Jesus never promoted violence or intolerance. He openly
condemned the use of force to gain power over others: “You know that
the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones are
tyrants over them. It will not be so among you” (<i>Mt</i> 20:25-26). Instead, the Gospel tells us to forgive “seventy times seven” (<i>Mt</i> 18:22) and offers the example of the unmerciful servant who was himself forgiven, yet unable to forgive others in turn (cf. <i> Mt</i> 18:23-35).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>239. Reading other texts of the New Testament, we can see how the
early Christian communities, living in a pagan world marked by
widespread corruption and aberrations, sought to show unfailing
patience, tolerance and understanding. Some texts are very clear in
this regard: we are told to admonish our opponents “with gentleness” (<i>2 Tim</i>
2:25) and encouraged “to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to
be gentle, and to show every courtesy to everyone. For we ourselves
were once foolish” (<i>Tit</i> 3:2-3). The Acts of the Apostles notes
that the disciples, albeit persecuted by some of the authorities, “had
favour with all the people” (2:47; cf. 4:21.33; 5:13).</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>240. Yet when we reflect upon forgiveness, peace and social harmony,
we also encounter the jarring saying of Christ: “Do not think that I
have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace,
but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a
daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law; and a man’s foes will be members of his own household” (<i>Mt</i>
10:34-36). These words need to be understood in the context of the
chapter in which they are found, where it is clear that Jesus is
speaking of fidelity to our decision to follow him; we are not to be
ashamed of that decision, even if it entails hardships of various
sorts, and even our loved ones refuse to accept it. Christ’s words do
not encourage us to seek conflict, but simply to endure it when it
inevitably comes, lest deference to others, for the sake of supposed
peace in our families or society, should detract from our own fidelity.
Saint John Paul II observed that the Church “does not intend to condemn
every possible form of social conflict. The Church is well aware that
in the course of history conflicts of interest between different social
groups inevitably arise, and that in the face of such conflicts
Christians must often take a position, honestly and decisively”.<a name="_ftnref223" title="" href="#_ftn223">[223]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Legitimate_conflict_and_forgiveness">Legitimate conflict and forgiveness</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>241. Nor does this mean calling for forgiveness when it involves
renouncing our own rights, confronting corrupt officials, criminals or
those who would debase our dignity. We are called to love everyone,
without exception; at the same time, loving an oppressor does not mean
allowing him to keep oppressing us, or letting him think that what he
does is acceptable. On the contrary, true love for an oppressor means
seeking ways to make him cease his oppression; it means stripping him
of a power that he does not know how to use, and that diminishes his
own humanity and that of others. Forgiveness does not entail allowing
oppressors to keep trampling on their own dignity and that of others,
or letting criminals continue their wrongdoing. Those who suffer
injustice have to defend strenuously their own rights and those of
their family, precisely because they must preserve the dignity they
have received as a loving gift from God. If a criminal has harmed me or
a loved one, no one can forbid me from demanding justice and ensuring
that this person – or anyone else – will not harm me, or others, again.
This is entirely just; forgiveness does not forbid it but actually
demands it.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>242. The important thing is not to fuel anger, which is unhealthy
for our own soul and the soul of our people, or to become obsessed with
taking revenge and destroying the other. No one achieves inner peace or
returns to a normal life in that way. The truth is that “no family, no
group of neighbours, no ethnic group, much less a nation, has a future
if the force that unites them, brings them together and resolves their
differences is vengeance and hatred. We cannot come to terms and unite
for the sake of revenge, or treating others with the same violence with
which they treated us, or plotting opportunities for retaliation under
apparently legal auspices”.<a name="_ftnref224" title="" href="#_ftn224">[224]</a> Nothing is gained this way and, in the end, everything is lost.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>243. To be sure, “it is no easy task to overcome the bitter legacy
of injustices, hostility and mistrust left by conflict. It can only be
done by overcoming evil with good (cf. <i>Rom </i>12:21) and by cultivating those virtues which foster reconciliation, solidarity and peace”.<a name="_ftnref225" title="" href="#_ftn225">[225]</a>
In this way, “persons who nourish goodness in their heart find that
such goodness leads to a peaceful conscience and to profound joy, even
in the midst of difficulties and misunderstandings. Even when
affronted, goodness is never weak but rather, shows its strength by
refusing to take revenge”.<a name="_ftnref226" title="" href="#_ftn226">[226]</a>
Each of us should realize that “even the harsh judgment I hold in my
heart against my brother or my sister, the open wound that was never
cured, the offense that was never forgiven, the rancour that is only
going to hurt me, are all instances of a struggle that I carry within
me, a little flame deep in my heart that needs to be extinguished
before it turns into a great blaze”.<a name="_ftnref227" title="" href="#_ftn227">[227]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>244. When conflicts are not resolved but kept hidden or buried in
the past, silence can lead to complicity in grave misdeeds and sins.
Authentic reconciliation does not flee from conflict, but is achieved <i>in</i>
conflict, resolving it through dialogue and open, honest and patient
negotiation. Conflict between different groups “if it abstains from
enmities and mutual hatred, gradually changes into an honest discussion
of differences founded on a desire for justice”.<a name="_ftnref228" title="" href="#_ftn228">[228]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>245. On numerous occasions, I have spoken of “a principle
indispensable to the building of friendship in society: namely, that
unity is greater than conflict… This is not to opt for a kind of
syncretism, or for the absorption of one into the other, but rather for
a resolution which takes place on a higher plane and preserves what is
valid and useful on both sides”.<a name="_ftnref229" title="" href="#_ftn229">[229]</a>
All of us know that “when we, as individuals and communities, learn to
look beyond ourselves and our particular interests, then understanding
and mutual commitment bear fruit… in a setting where conflicts,
tensions and even groups once considered inimical can attain a
multifaceted unity that gives rise to new life”.<a name="_ftnref230" title="" href="#_ftn230">[230]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="MEMORY">MEMORY</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>246. Of those who have endured much unjust and cruel suffering, a
sort of “social forgiveness” must not be demanded. Reconciliation is a
personal act, and no one can impose it upon an entire society, however
great the need to foster it. In a strictly personal way, someone, by a
free and generous decision, can choose not to demand punishment (cf. <i>Mt</i>
5:44-46), even if it is quite legitimately demanded by society and its
justice system. However, it is not possible to proclaim a “blanket
reconciliation” in an effort to bind wounds by decree or to cover
injustices in a cloak of oblivion. Who can claim the right to forgive
in the name of others? It is moving to see forgiveness shown by those
who are able to leave behind the harm they suffered, but it is also
humanly understandable in the case of those who cannot. In any case,
forgetting is never the answer. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>247. The <i>Shoah</i> must not be forgotten. It is “the enduring
symbol of the depths to which human evil can sink when, spurred by
false ideologies, it fails to recognize the fundamental dignity of each
person, which merits unconditional respect regardless of ethnic origin
or religious belief”.<a name="_ftnref231" title="" href="#_ftn231">[231]</a>
As I think of it, I cannot help but repeat this prayer: “Lord, remember
us in your mercy. Grant us the grace to be ashamed of what we men have
done, to be ashamed of this massive idolatry, of having despised and
destroyed our own flesh which you formed from the earth, to which you
gave life with your own breath of life. Never again, Lord, never
again!”.<a name="_ftnref232" title="" href="#_ftn232">[232]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>248. Nor must we forget the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. Once again, “I pay homage to all the victims, and I bow
before the strength and dignity of those who, having survived those
first moments, for years afterward bore in the flesh immense suffering,
and in their spirit seeds of death that drained their vital energy… We
cannot allow present and future generations to lose the memory of what
happened. It is a memory that ensures and encourages the building of a
more fair and fraternal future”.<a name="_ftnref233" title="" href="#_ftn233">[233]</a>
Neither must we forget the persecutions, the slave trade and the ethnic
killings that continue in various countries, as well as the many other
historical events that make us ashamed of our humanity. They need to be
remembered, always and ever anew. We must never grow accustomed or
inured to them.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>249. Nowadays, it is easy to be tempted to turn the page, to say
that all these things happened long ago and we should look to the
future. For God’s sake, no! We can never move forward without
remembering the past; we do not progress without an honest and
unclouded memory. We need to “keep alive the flame of collective
conscience, bearing witness to succeeding generations to the horror of
what happened”, because that witness “awakens and preserves the memory
of the victims, so that the conscience of humanity may rise up in the
face of every desire for dominance and destruction”.<a name="_ftnref234" title="" href="#_ftn234">[234]</a>
The victims themselves – individuals, social groups or nations – need
to do so, lest they succumb to the mindset that leads to justifying
reprisals and every kind of violence in the name of the great evil
endured. For this reason, I think not only of the need to remember the
atrocities, but also all those who, amid such great inhumanity and
corruption, retained their dignity and, with gestures small or large,
chose the part of solidarity, forgiveness and fraternity. To remember
goodness is also a healthy thing.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Forgiving_but_not_forgetting">Forgiving but not forgetting</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>250. Forgiving does not mean forgetting. Or better, in the face of a
reality that can in no way be denied, relativized or concealed,
forgiveness is still possible. In the face of an action that can never
be tolerated, justified or excused, we can still forgive. In the face
of something that cannot be forgotten for any reason, we can still
forgive. Free and heartfelt forgiveness is something noble, a
reflection of God’s own infinite ability to forgive. If forgiveness is
gratuitous, then it can be shown even to someone who resists repentance
and is unable to beg pardon.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>251. Those who truly forgive do not forget. Instead, they choose not
to yield to the same destructive force that caused them so much
suffering. They break the vicious circle; they halt the advance of the
forces of destruction. They choose not to spread in society the spirit
of revenge that will sooner or later return to take its toll. Revenge
never truly satisfies victims. Some crimes are so horrendous and cruel
that the punishment of those who perpetrated them does not serve to
repair the harm done. Even killing the criminal would not be enough,
nor could any form of torture prove commensurate with the sufferings
inflicted on the victim. Revenge resolves nothing.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>252. This does not mean impunity. Justice is properly sought solely
out of love of justice itself, out of respect for the victims, as a
means of preventing new crimes and protecting the common good, not as
an alleged outlet for personal anger. Forgiveness is precisely what
enables us to pursue justice without falling into a spiral of revenge
or the injustice of forgetting.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>253. When injustices have occurred on both sides, it is important to
take into clear account whether they were equally grave or in any way
comparable. Violence perpetrated by the state, using its structures and
power, is not on the same level as that perpetrated by particular
groups. In any event, one cannot claim that the unjust sufferings of
one side alone should be commemorated. The Bishops of Croatia have
stated that, “we owe equal respect to every innocent victim. There can
be no racial, national, confessional or partisan differences”.<a name="_ftnref235" title="" href="#_ftn235">[235]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>254. I ask God “to prepare our hearts to encounter our brothers and
sisters, so that we may overcome our differences rooted in political
thinking, language, culture and religion. Let us ask him to anoint<i> </i>our
whole being with the balm of his mercy, which heals the injuries caused
by mistakes, misunderstandings and disputes. And let us ask him for the
grace to send<i> </i> us forth, in humility and meekness, along the demanding but enriching path of seeking peace”.<a name="_ftnref236" title="" href="#_ftn236">[236]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="WAR_AND_THE_DEATH_PENALTY">WAR AND THE DEATH PENALTY</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>255. There are two extreme situations that may come to be seen as
solutions in especially dramatic circumstances, without realizing that
they are false answers that do not resolve the problems they are meant
to solve and ultimately do no more than introduce new elements of
destruction in the fabric of national and global society. These are war
and the death penalty.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="The_injustice_of_war_">The injustice of war</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>256. “Deceit is in the mind of those who plan evil, but those who counsel peace have joy” (<i>Prov</i>
12:20). Yet there are those who seek solutions in war, frequently
fueled by a breakdown in relations, hegemonic ambitions, abuses of
power, fear of others and a tendency to see diversity as an obstacle.<a name="_ftnref237" title="" href="#_ftn237">[237]</a>
War is not a ghost from the past but a constant threat. Our world is
encountering growing difficulties on the slow path to peace upon which
it had embarked and which had already begun to bear good fruit.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>257. Since conditions that favour the outbreak of wars are once
again increasing, I can only reiterate that “war is the negation of all
rights and a dramatic assault on the environment. If we want true
integral human development for all, we must work tirelessly to avoid
war between nations and peoples. To this end, there is a need to ensure
the uncontested rule of law and tireless recourse to negotiation,
mediation and arbitration, as proposed by the <i> Charter of the United Nations</i>, which constitutes truly a fundamental juridical norm”.<a name="_ftnref238" title="" href="#_ftn238">[238]</a>
The seventy-five years since the establishment of the United Nations
and the experience of the first twenty years of this millennium have
shown that the full application of international norms proves truly
effective, and that failure to comply with them is detrimental. The <i>Charter of the United Nations</i>,
when observed and applied with transparency and sincerity, is an
obligatory reference point of justice and a channel of peace. Here
there can be no room for disguising false intentions or placing the
partisan interests of one country or group above the global common
good. If rules are considered simply as means to be used whenever it
proves advantageous, and to be ignored when it is not, uncontrollable
forces are unleashed that cause grave harm to societies, to the poor
and vulnerable, to fraternal relations, to the environment and to
cultural treasures, with irretrievable losses for the global community.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>258. War can easily be chosen by invoking all sorts of allegedly
humanitarian, defensive or precautionary excuses, and even resorting to
the manipulation of information. In recent decades, every single war
has been ostensibly “justified”. The <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> speaks of the possibility of legitimate <i>defence</i> by means of military force, which involves demonstrating that certain “rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy”<a name="_ftnref239" title="" href="#_ftn239">[239]</a>
have been met. Yet it is easy to fall into an overly broad
interpretation of this potential right. In this way, some would also
wrongly justify even “preventive” attacks or acts of war that can
hardly avoid entailing “evils and disorders graver than the evil to be
eliminated”.<a name="_ftnref240" title="" href="#_ftn240">[240]</a> At
issue is whether the development of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons, and the enormous and growing possibilities offered by new
technologies, have granted war an uncontrollable destructive power over
great numbers of innocent civilians. The truth is that “never has
humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will
be used wisely”.<a name="_ftnref241" title="" href="#_ftn241">[241]</a>
We can no longer think of war as a solution, because its risks will
probably always be greater than its supposed benefits. In view of this,
it is very difficult nowadays to invoke the rational criteria
elaborated in earlier centuries to speak of the possibility of a “just
war”. Never again war!<a name="_ftnref242" title="" href="#_ftn242">[242]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>259. It should be added that, with increased globalization, what
might appear as an immediate or practical solution for one part of the
world initiates a chain of violent and often latent effects that end up
harming the entire planet and opening the way to new and worse wars in
the future. In today’s world, there are no longer just isolated
outbreaks of war in one country or another; instead, we are
experiencing a “world war fought piecemeal”, since the destinies of
countries are so closely interconnected on the global scene.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>260. In the words of Saint John XXIII, “it no longer makes sense to
maintain that war is a fit instrument with which to repair the
violation of justice”.<a name="_ftnref243" title="" href="#_ftn243">[243]</a>
In making this point amid great international tension, he voiced the
growing desire for peace emerging in the Cold War period. He supported
the conviction that the arguments for peace are stronger than any
calculation of particular interests and confidence in the use of
weaponry. The opportunities offered by the end of the Cold War were
not, however, adequately seized due to a lack of a vision for the
future and a shared consciousness of our common destiny. Instead, it
proved easier to pursue partisan interests without upholding the
universal common good. The dread spectre of war thus began to gain new
ground.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>261. Every war leaves our world worse than it was before. War is a
failure of politics and of humanity, a shameful capitulation, a
stinging defeat before the forces of evil. Let us not remain mired in
theoretical discussions, but touch the wounded flesh of the victims.
Let us look once more at all those civilians whose killing was
considered “collateral damage”. Let us ask the victims themselves. Let
us think of the refugees and displaced, those who suffered the effects
of atomic radiation or chemical attacks, the mothers who lost their
children, and the boys and girls maimed or deprived of their childhood.
Let us hear the true stories of these victims of violence, look at
reality through their eyes, and listen with an open heart to the
stories they tell. In this way, we will be able to grasp the abyss of
evil at the heart of war. Nor will it trouble us to be deemed naive for
choosing peace.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>262. Rules by themselves will not suffice if we continue to think
that the solution to current problems is deterrence through fear or the
threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Indeed, “if we take
into consideration the principal threats to peace and security with
their many dimensions in this multipolar world of the twenty-first
century as, for example, terrorism, asymmetrical conflicts,
cybersecurity, environmental problems, poverty, not a few doubts arise
regarding the inadequacy of nuclear deterrence as an effective response
to such challenges. These concerns are even greater when we consider
the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental consequences that would
follow from any use of nuclear weapons, with devastating,
indiscriminate and uncontainable effects, over time and space… We need
also to ask ourselves how sustainable is a stability based on fear,
when it actually increases fear and undermines relationships of trust
between peoples. International peace and stability cannot be based on a
false sense of security, on the threat of mutual destruction or total
annihilation, or on simply maintaining a balance of power… In this
context, the ultimate goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons
becomes both a challenge and a moral and humanitarian imperative…
Growing interdependence and globalization mean that any response to the
threat of nuclear weapons should be collective and concerted, based on
mutual trust. This trust can be built only through dialogue that is
truly directed to the common good and not to the protection of veiled
or particular interests”.<a name="_ftnref244" title="" href="#_ftn244">[244]</a> With the money spent on weapons and other military expenditures, let us establish a global fund<a name="_ftnref245" title="" href="#_ftn245">[245]</a>
that can finally put an end to hunger and favour development in the
most impoverished countries, so that their citizens will not resort to
violent or illusory solutions, or have to leave their countries in
order to seek a more dignified life.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="The_death_penalty">The death penalty</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>263. There is yet another way to eliminate others, one aimed not at
countries but at individuals. It is the death penalty. Saint John Paul
II stated clearly and firmly that the death penalty is inadequate from
a moral standpoint and no longer necessary from that of penal justice.<a name="_ftnref246" title="" href="#_ftn246">[246]</a> There can be no stepping back from this position. Today we state clearly that “the death penalty is inadmissible”<a name="_ftnref247" title="" href="#_ftn247">[247]</a> and the Church is firmly committed to calling for its abolition worldwide.<a name="_ftnref248" title="" href="#_ftn248">[248]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>264. In the New Testament, while individuals are asked not to take justice into their own hands (cf. <i>Rom</i> 12:17.19), there is also a recognition of the need for authorities to impose penalties on evildoers (cf. <i>Rom</i> 13:4; <i>1 Pet</i>
2:14). Indeed, “civic life, structured around an organized community,
needs rules of coexistence, the wilful violation of which demands
appropriate redress”.<a name="_ftnref249" title="" href="#_ftn249">[249]</a> This means that legitimate public authority can and must “inflict punishments according to the seriousness of the crimes”<a name="_ftnref250" title="" href="#_ftn250">[250]</a> and that judicial power be guaranteed a “necessary independence in the realm of law”.<a name="_ftnref251" title="" href="#_ftn251">[251]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>265. From the earliest centuries of the Church, some were clearly
opposed to capital punishment. Lactantius, for example, held that
“there ought to be no exception at all; that it is always unlawful to
put a man to death”.<a name="_ftnref252" title="" href="#_ftn252">[252]</a>
Pope Nicholas I urged that efforts be made “to free from the punishment
of death not only each of the innocent, but all the guilty as well”.<a name="_ftnref253" title="" href="#_ftn253">[253]</a><a name="_ftnref254" title="" href="#_ftn254">[254]</a>
During the trial of the murderers of two priests, Saint Augustine asked
the judge not to take the life of the assassins with this argument: “We
do not object to your depriving these wicked men of the freedom to
commit further crimes. Our desire is rather that justice be satisfied
without the taking of their lives or the maiming of their bodies in any
part. And, at the same time, that by the coercive measures provided by
the law, they be turned from their irrational fury to the calmness of
men of sound mind, and from their evil deeds to some useful employment.
This too is considered a condemnation, but who does not see that, when
savage violence is restrained and remedies meant to produce repentance
are provided, it should be considered a benefit rather than a mere
punitive measure… Do not let the atrocity of their sins feed a desire
for vengeance, but desire instead to heal the wounds which those deeds
have inflicted on their souls”.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>266. Fear and resentment can easily lead to viewing punishment in a
vindictive and even cruel way, rather than as part of a process of
healing and reintegration into society. Nowadays, “in some political
sectors and certain media, public and private violence and revenge are
incited, not only against those responsible for committing crimes, but
also against those suspected, whether proven or not, of breaking the
law… There is at times a tendency to deliberately fabricate enemies:
stereotyped figures who represent all the characteristics that society
perceives or interprets as threatening. The mechanisms that form these
images are the same that allowed the spread of racist ideas in their
time”.<a name="_ftnref255" title="" href="#_ftn255">[255]</a> This has
made all the more dangerous the growing practice in some countries of
resorting to preventive custody, imprisonment without trial and
especially the death penalty.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>267. Here I would stress that “it is impossible to imagine that
states today have no other means than capital punishment to protect the
lives of other people from the unjust aggressor”. Particularly serious
in this regard are so-called extrajudicial or extralegal executions,
which are “homicides deliberately committed by certain states and by
their agents, often passed off as clashes with criminals or presented
as the unintended consequences of the reasonable, necessary and
proportionate use of force in applying the law”.<a name="_ftnref256" title="" href="#_ftn256">[256]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>268. “The arguments against the death penalty are numerous and
well-known. The Church has rightly called attention to several of
these, such as the possibility of judicial error and the use made of
such punishment by totalitarian and dictatorial regimes as a means of
suppressing political dissidence or persecuting religious and cultural
minorities, all victims whom the legislation of those regimes consider
‘delinquents’. All Christians and people of good will are today called
to work not only for the abolition of the death penalty, legal or
illegal, in all its forms, but also to work for the improvement of
prison conditions, out of respect for the human dignity of persons
deprived of their freedom. I would link this to life imprisonment… A
life sentence is a secret death penalty”.<a name="_ftnref257" title="" href="#_ftn257">[257]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>269. Let us keep in mind that “not even a murderer loses his personal dignity, and God himself pledges to guarantee this”.<a name="_ftnref258" title="" href="#_ftn258">[258]</a>
The firm rejection of the death penalty shows to what extent it is
possible to recognize the inalienable dignity of every human being and
to accept that he or she has a place in this universe. If I do not deny
that dignity to the worst of criminals, I will not deny it to anyone. I
will give everyone the possibility of sharing this planet with me,
despite all our differences.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>270. I ask Christians who remain hesitant on this point, and those
tempted to yield to violence in any form, to keep in mind the words of
the book of Isaiah: “They shall beat their swords into plowshares”
(2:4). For us, this prophecy took flesh in Christ Jesus who, seeing a
disciple tempted to violence, said firmly: “Put your sword back into
its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword” (<i>Mt</i>
26:52). These words echoed the ancient warning: “I will require a
reckoning for human life. Whoever sheds the blood of a man, by man
shall his blood be shed” (<i>Gen</i> 9:5-6). Jesus’ reaction, which
sprang from his heart, bridges the gap of the centuries and reaches the
present as an enduring appeal.</big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>271. The different religions, based on their respect for each human
person as a creature called to be a child of God, contribute
significantly to building fraternity and defending justice in society.
Dialogue between the followers of different religions does not take
place simply for the sake of diplomacy, consideration or tolerance. In
the words of the Bishops of India, “the goal of dialogue is to
establish friendship, peace and harmony, and to share spiritual and
moral values and experiences in a spirit of truth and love”.<a name="_ftnref259" title="" href="#_ftn259">[259]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><a name="THE_ULTIMATE_FOUNDATION">THE ULTIMATE FOUNDATION</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>272. As believers, we are convinced that, without an openness to the
Father of all, there will be no solid and stable reasons for an appeal
to fraternity. We are certain that “only with this awareness that we
are not orphans, but children, can we live in peace with one another”.<a name="_ftnref260" title="" href="#_ftn260">[260]</a>
For “reason, by itself, is capable of grasping the equality between men
and of giving stability to their civic coexistence, but it cannot
establish fraternity”.<a name="_ftnref261" title="" href="#_ftn261">[261]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>273. In this regard, I wish to cite the following memorable
statement: “If there is no transcendent truth, in obedience to which
man achieves his full identity, then there is no sure principle for
guaranteeing just relations between people. Their self-interest as a
class, group or nation would inevitably set them in opposition to one
another. If one does not acknowledge transcendent truth, then the force
of power takes over, and each person tends to make full use of the
means at his disposal in order to impose his own interests or his own
opinion, with no regard for the rights of others… The root of modern
totalitarianism is to be found in the denial of the transcendent
dignity of the human person who, as the visible image of the invisible
God, is therefore by his very nature the subject of rights that no one
may violate – no individual, group, class, nation or state. Not even
the majority of the social body may violate these rights, by going
against the minority”.<a name="_ftnref262" title="" href="#_ftn262">[262]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>274. From our faith experience and from the wisdom accumulated over
centuries, but also from lessons learned from our many weaknesses and
failures, we, the believers of the different religions, know that our
witness to God benefits our societies. The effort to seek God with a
sincere heart, provided it is never sullied by ideological or
self-serving aims, helps us recognize one another as travelling
companions, truly brothers and sisters. We are convinced that “when, in
the name of an ideology, there is an attempt to remove God from a
society, that society ends up adoring idols, and very soon men and
women lose their way, their dignity is trampled and their rights
violated. You know well how much suffering is caused by the denial of
freedom of conscience and of religious freedom, and how that wound
leaves a humanity which is impoverished, because it lacks hope and
ideals to guide it”.<a name="_ftnref263" title="" href="#_ftn263">[263]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>275. It should be acknowledged that “among the most important causes
of the crises of the modern world are a desensitized human conscience,
a distancing from religious values and the prevailing individualism
accompanied by materialistic philosophies that deify the human person
and introduce worldly and material values in place of supreme and
transcendental principles”.<a name="_ftnref264" title="" href="#_ftn264">[264]</a>
It is wrong when the only voices to be heard in public debate are those
of the powerful and “experts”. Room needs to be made for reflections
born of religious traditions that are the repository of centuries of
experience and wisdom. For “religious classics can prove meaningful in
every age; they have an enduring power [to open new horizons, to
stimulate thought, to expand the mind and the heart]”. Yet often they
are viewed with disdain as a result of “the myopia of a certain
rationalism”.<a name="_ftnref265" title="" href="#_ftn265">[265]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>276. For these reasons, the Church, while respecting the autonomy of
political life, does not restrict her mission to the private sphere. On
the contrary, “she cannot and must not remain on the sidelines” in the
building of a better world, or fail to “reawaken the spiritual energy”
that can contribute to the betterment of society.<a name="_ftnref266" title="" href="#_ftn266">[266]</a>
It is true that religious ministers must not engage in the party
politics that are the proper domain of the laity, but neither can they
renounce the political dimension of life itself,<a name="_ftnref267" title="" href="#_ftn267">[267]</a>
which involves a constant attention to the common good and a concern
for integral human development. The Church “has a public role over and
above her charitable and educational activities”. She works for “the
advancement of humanity and of universal fraternity”.<a name="_ftnref268" title="" href="#_ftn268">[268]</a>
She does not claim to compete with earthly powers, but to offer herself
as “a family among families, this is the Church, open to bearing
witness in today’s world, open to faith hope and love for the Lord and
for those whom he loves with a preferential love. A home with open
doors. The Church is a home with open doors, because she is a mother”.<a name="_ftnref269" title="" href="#_ftn269">[269]</a>
And in imitation of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, “we want to be a Church
that serves, that leaves home and goes forth from its places of
worship, goes forth from its sacristies, in order to accompany life, to
sustain hope, to be the sign of unity… to build bridges, to break down
walls, to sow seeds of reconciliation”.<a name="_ftnref270" title="" href="#_ftn270">[270]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="Christian_identity">Christian identity</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>277. The Church esteems the ways in which God works in other
religions, and “rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these
religions. She has a high regard for their manner of life and conduct,
their precepts and doctrines which… often reflect a ray of that truth
which enlightens all men and women”.<a name="_ftnref271" title="" href="#_ftn271">[271]</a>
Yet we Christians are very much aware that “if the music of the Gospel
ceases to resonate in our very being, we will lose the joy born of
compassion, the tender love born of trust, the capacity for
reconciliation that has its source in our knowledge that we have been
forgiven and sent forth. If the music of the Gospel ceases to sound in
our homes, our public squares, our workplaces, our political and
financial life, then we will no longer hear the strains that challenge
us to defend the dignity of every man and woman”.<a name="_ftnref272" title="" href="#_ftn272">[272]</a>
Others drink from other sources. For us the wellspring of human dignity
and fraternity is in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. From it, there arises,
“for Christian thought and for the action of the Church, the primacy
given to relationship, to the encounter with the sacred mystery of the
other, to universal communion with the entire human family, as a
vocation of all”.<a name="_ftnref273" title="" href="#_ftn273">[273]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>278. Called to take root in every place, the Church has been present
for centuries throughout the world, for that is what it means to be
“catholic”. She can thus understand, from her own experience of grace
and sin, the beauty of the invitation to universal love. Indeed, “all
things human are our concern… wherever the councils of nations come
together to establish the rights and duties of man, we are honoured to
be permitted to take our place among them”.<a name="_ftnref274" title="" href="#_ftn274">[274]</a>
For many Christians, this journey of fraternity also has a Mother,
whose name is Mary. Having received this universal motherhood at the
foot of the cross (cf. <i>Jn </i>19:26), she cares not only for Jesus but also for “the rest of her children” (cf. <i>Rev </i>12:17).
In the power of the risen Lord, she wants to give birth to a new world,
where all of us are brothers and sisters, where there is room for all
those whom our societies discard, where justice and peace are
resplendent. </big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>279. We Christians ask that, in those countries where we are a
minority, we be guaranteed freedom, even as we ourselves promote that
freedom for non-Christians in places where they are a minority. One
fundamental human right must not be forgotten in the journey towards
fraternity and peace. It is religious freedom for believers of all
religions. That freedom proclaims that we can “build harmony and
understanding between different cultures and religions. It also
testifies to the fact that, since the important things we share are so
many, it is possible to find a means of serene, ordered and peaceful
coexistence, accepting our differences and rejoicing that, as children
of the one God, we are all brothers and sisters”.<a name="_ftnref275" title="" href="#_ftn275">[275]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>280. At the same time, we ask God to strengthen unity within the
Church, a unity enriched by differences reconciled by the working of
the Spirit. For “in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body” (<i>1 Cor </i>12:13),
in which each member has his or her distinctive contribution to make.
As Saint Augustine said, “the ear sees through the eye, and the eye
hears through the ear”.<a name="_ftnref276" title="" href="#_ftn276">[276]</a>
It is also urgent to continue to bear witness to the journey of
encounter between the different Christian confessions. We cannot forget
Christ’s desire “that they may all be one” (cf. <i>Jn </i>17:21).
Hearing his call, we recognize with sorrow that the process of
globalization still lacks the prophetic and spiritual contribution of
unity among Christians. This notwithstanding, “even as we make this
journey towards full communion, we already have the duty to offer
common witness to the love of God for all people by working together in
the service of humanity”.<a name="_ftnref277" title="" href="#_ftn277">[277]</a></big></font></big></p><big>

</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>281. A journey of peace is possible between religions. Its point of
departure must be God’s way of seeing things. “God does not see with
his eyes, God sees with his heart. And God’s love is the same for
everyone, regardless of religion. Even if they are atheists, his love
is the same. When the last day comes, and there is sufficient light to
see things as they really are, we are going to find ourselves quite
surprised”.<a name="_ftnref278" title="" href="#_ftn278">[278]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>282. It follows that “we believers need to find occasions to speak
with one another and to act together for the common good and the
promotion of the poor. This has nothing to do with watering down or
concealing our deepest convictions when we encounter others who think
differently than ourselves… For the deeper, stronger and richer our own
identity is, the more we will be capable of enriching others with our
own proper contribution”.<a name="_ftnref279" title="" href="#_ftn279">[279]</a>
We believers are challenged to return to our sources, in order to
concentrate on what is essential: worship of God and love for our
neighbour, lest some of our teachings, taken out of context, end up
feeding forms of contempt, hatred, xenophobia or negation of others.
The truth is that violence has no basis in our fundamental religious
convictions, but only in their distortion.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>283. Sincere and humble worship of God “bears fruit not in
discrimination, hatred and violence, but in respect for the sacredness
of life, respect for the dignity and freedom of others, and loving
commitment to the welfare of all”.<a name="_ftnref280" title="" href="#_ftn280">[280]</a> Truly, “whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love” (<i>1 Jn </i>
4:8). For this reason, “terrorism is deplorable and threatens the
security of people – be they in the East or the West, the North or the
South – and disseminates panic, terror and pessimism, but this is not
due to religion, even when terrorists instrumentalize it. It is due,
rather, to an accumulation of incorrect interpretations of religious
texts and to policies linked to hunger, poverty, injustice, oppression
and pride. That is why it is so necessary to stop supporting terrorist
movements fuelled by financing, the provision of weapons and strategy,
and by attempts to justify these movements, even using the media. All
these must be regarded as international crimes that threaten security
and world peace. Such terrorism must be condemned in all its forms and
expressions”.<a name="_ftnref281" title="" href="#_ftn281">[281]</a>
Religious convictions about the sacred meaning of human life permit us
“to recognize the fundamental values of our common humanity, values in
the name of which we can and must cooperate, build and dialogue, pardon
and grow; this will allow different voices to unite in creating a
melody of sublime nobility and beauty, instead of fanatical cries of
hatred”.<a name="_ftnref282" title="" href="#_ftn282">[282]</a></big></font> </big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>284. At times fundamentalist violence is unleashed in some groups,
of whatever religion, by the rashness of their leaders. Yet, “the
commandment of peace is inscribed in the depths of the religious
traditions that we represent… As religious leaders, we are called to be
true ‘people of dialogue’, to cooperate in building peace not as
intermediaries but as authentic mediators. Intermediaries seek to give
everyone a discount, ultimately in order to gain something for
themselves. The mediator, on the other hand, is one who retains nothing
for himself, but rather spends himself generously until he is consumed,
knowing that the only gain is peace. Each one of us is called to be an
artisan of peace, by uniting and not dividing, by extinguishing hatred
and not holding on to it, by opening paths of dialogue and not by
constructing new walls”.<a name="_ftnref283" title="" href="#_ftn283">[283]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big><i><a name="An_appeal">An appeal</a></i></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>285. In my fraternal meeting, which I gladly recall, with the Grand
Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, “we resolutely [declared] that religions must
never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must
they incite violence or the shedding of blood. These tragic realities
are the consequence of a deviation from religious teachings. They
result from a political manipulation of religions and from
interpretations made by religious groups who, in the course of history,
have taken advantage of the power of religious sentiment in the hearts
of men and women… God, the Almighty, has no need to be defended by
anyone and does not want his name to be used to terrorize people”.<a name="_ftnref284" title="" href="#_ftn284">[284]</a> For this reason I would like to reiterate here the appeal for peace, justice and fraternity that we made together:</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of God, who has created all human beings equal in
rights, duties and dignity, and who has called them to live together as
brothers and sisters, to fill the earth and make known the values of
goodness, love and peace;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of innocent human life that God has forbidden to kill,
affirming that whoever kills a person is like one who kills the whole
of humanity, and that whoever saves a person is like one who saves the
whole of humanity;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of the poor, the destitute, the marginalized and those
most in need, whom God has commanded us to help as a duty required of
all persons, especially the wealthy and those of means;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of orphans, widows, refugees and those exiled from
their homes and their countries; in the name of all victims of wars,
persecution and injustice; in the name of the weak, those who live in
fear, prisoners of war and those tortured in any part of the world,
without distinction;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of peoples who have lost their security, peace and the
possibility of living together, becoming victims of destruction,
calamity and war;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of <i>human fraternity</i>, that embraces all human beings, unites them and renders them equal;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of this <i>fraternity</i> torn apart by policies of
extremism and division, by systems of unrestrained profit or by hateful
ideological tendencies that manipulate the actions and the future of
men and women;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of freedom, that God has given to all human beings, creating them free and setting them apart by this gift;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of justice and mercy, the foundations of prosperity and the cornerstone of faith;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of all persons of goodwill present in every part of the world;</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>“In the name of God and of everything stated thus far, [we] declare
the adoption of a culture of dialogue as the path; mutual cooperation
as the code of conduct; reciprocal understanding as the method and
standard”.<a name="_ftnref285" title="" href="#_ftn285">[285]</a></big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p align="center"><big><font size="+1"><big>* * *</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>286. In these pages of reflection on universal fraternity, I felt
inspired particularly by Saint Francis of Assisi, but also by others of
our brothers and sisters who are not Catholics: Martin Luther King,
Desmond Tutu, Mahatma Gandhi and many more. Yet I would like to
conclude by mentioning another person of deep faith who, drawing upon
his intense experience of God, made a journey of transformation towards
feeling a brother to all. I am speaking of Blessed Charles de Foucauld.</big></font></big></p><big> 
</big><p><big><font size="+1"><big>287. Blessed Charles directed his ideal of total surrender to God
towards an identification with the poor, abandoned in the depths of the
African desert. In that setting, he expressed his desire to feel
himself a brother to every human being,<a name="_ftnref286" title="" href="#_ftn286">[286]</a> and asked a friend to “pray to God that I truly be the brother of all”.<a name="_ftnref287" title="" href="#_ftn287">[287]</a> He wanted to be, in the end, “the universal brother”.<a name="_ftnref288" title="" href="#_ftn288">[288]</a>
Yet only by identifying with the least did he come at last to be the
brother of all. May God inspire that dream in each one of us. Amen.</big></font></big></p><big>
