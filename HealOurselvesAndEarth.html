  <h4>A FEW WAYS TO HEAL OURSELVES and MOTHER EARTH</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a choice between laughing and crying, try to laugh, but crying is natural and healthy too.</li>
      <li>If you build a house on a hill, don't tear down the hill.</li>
      <li>When using water use each drop wisely as if you were in a desert, with a limited amount.</li>
      <li>Use only what you need to sustain your household circle.</li>
      <li>Give thanks for the foods you eat, remembering most of the world is hungry.</li>
      <li>Don't kill animals such as snakes; learn to live in harmony with bugs and spiders.</li>
      <li>Respect and honour those on other paths.</li>
      <li>Eat healthy, life giving foods.</li>
      <li>Help people in need.</li>
      <li>Re-cycle as much waste as you can.</li>
      <li>Support causes that help save the Earth.</li>
      <li>Savour each day by living one day at a time.</li>
      <li>Use positive action rather than negative thought.</li>
      <li>Cultivate a spiritual garden as you would your vegetable garden, with effort and care.</li>
      <li>Feel nature's spirit when in the out-of-doors.</li>
      <li>Listen for the sounds of animals.</li>
      <li>Travel light.</li>
      <li>Take time to turn over a stone, and look at the world under it, then put it back as you found it.</li>
      <li>Learn to savour the different seasons, and the natural climatic changes.</li>
      <li>Celebrate life at every opportunity.</li>
      <li>Welcome the unknown, and wrap it around you like a new blanket.</li>
      <li>Laugh at yourself when everything seems bad, look to the good</li>
      <li>Appreciate yourself, you deserve it.</li>
    </ul>
