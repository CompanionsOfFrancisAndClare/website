    <h3>The Story and History of the Companions of Francis and Clare Fraternity</h3>

    <p>The Companions of Francis and Clare Fraternity is a Franciscan fraternity of the Third Order Secular (also known as Secular Franciscan Order or Ordo Franciscanus Saecularis) of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
    <p>Located in Southwest Virginia, the fraternity is in the <a href="http://saintmargaretofcortona.org/">St. Margaret of Cortona region</a> of the <a href="https://secularfranciscansusa.org/">national fraternity for the USA</a>. </p>


<p>The Fraternity dates its origin to 1994 when a Franciscan Friar, Andre Cirino, OFM, visited Francis of Assisi Church in Rocky Mount, Virginia and gave a one-week retreat on the “Spirituality of Saint Francis.”  Sister Fidelis, OSF, who was at that time, Pastoral Coordinator, initiated this retreat.  It was here that the idea germinated to start a Secular Franciscan Fraternity in Southwest Virginia.</p>

<p>Tom and Marianne Boyle were both motivated to become seculars themselves, but were unable to find a fraternity near them.  The closest fraternities in the Saint Margaret of Cortona Region were at Virginia Beach and Arlington, Virginia.  After much prayer and investigation, it became evident that the closest fraternity opportunity to Rocky Mount was in Greensboro, North Carolina, which, however, was not part of the Saint Margaret of Cortona Region.</p>

<p>Greensboro inquirers were starting their fraternity, and they welcomed Tom and Marianne Boyle into their profession class.  Their original instructor and spiritual advisor for these candidates was Father Louis Canino, OFM.  He presided at the profession ceremony for Tom and Marianne in May 1996.  They became part of the Franciscan Family of Greensboro Fraternity.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, the Boyles made a pilgrimage to Assisi with Father Cirino.  It was decided that they would attempt to start a new fraternity in Rocky Mount at Francis of Assisi Church.  The core group included Sister Fidelis, Tom and Marianne Boyle and two long professed Franciscans, Dot Scank, SFO of Rocky Mount and Jerry Webber, SFO of Roanoke.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1996, a letter was sent to all surrounding churches, announcing the first Franciscan Secular Information meeting.  About fifty interested Catholics assembled and they were briefed by Anne Coiro, SFO, the Regional Minister of Margaret of Cortona Region.  Anne explained Franciscan spirituality, the life of a Franciscan Secular and what was required to become a member the Secular Franciscan Order.</p>

<p>Following Anne Coiro’s SFO introduction, fifteen participated in the first inquiry session.  Fourteen became candidates at the Rite of Admission on June 22, 1997.  They included:  Tots Collins; Ted Crocker; Tom Fame; Jean Forrest; Cathy Griffin; Joan Kahwajy-Anderson; Glenn Kituskie; Joe Lamastro; Eileen Lamonthe; Dan Lonnquist; Lynne Lonnquist and Millie Swanwick.  Thirteen made perpetual profession into the newly developed Fraternity on June 21, 1998.  Dan Lonnquist made temporary profession for one year to further discern his vocation.  The following year Dan made perpetual profession.  Both ceremonies were presided over by Tom Boyle, SFO, temporary minister and Father Louis Canino, OFM, of Greensboro, North Carolina.</p>

<p>Three additional professed Seculars, Joan Jennings, SFO, Barney Jennings, SFO of Hillsville, Virginia and Beverley Dubelle, SFO of Francis of Assisi Church, joined the Fraternity.  The Fraternity held its’ first weekend retreat in March of 1998 which was conducted by Father Andre Cirino, OFM.</p>

<p>The Fraternity began a second formation group in the autumn of 1998.  Nine more candidates took part in the Rite of Admission on October 24, 1999.  Seven of these were professed on May 20, 2001: including Russ Beimler, SFO; Joan Beimler, SFO; Gary Cook, SFO; Marsha Dubose, SFO Vicki Hubbard, SFO, Patricia Mead, SFO and Marty White, SFO.</p>

<h4>SELECTING A FRATERNITY NAME AND CANONICAL ESTABLISHMENT</h4>

<p>The name chosen for the fraternity was the result of many months of prayer and thought. The members considered themselves “FrancisClarian,” active and contemplative, thus of Francis and Clare.  Companions came from bread - bread for the journey and bread of the Eucharist.</p>

<p>The official date for the Canonical Establishment of the Companions of Francis and Clare Fraternity was May 20, 2001.  
Canonical Establishment was facilitated by Anne Coiro, SFO, Saint Margaret of Cortona Regional Minister.
Tom Fame, SFO was elected Minister of the Companions of Francis and Clare.
The Fraternity has since had a number of Profession Ceremonies.
